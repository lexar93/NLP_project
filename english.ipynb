       " 'text': ['UNITED. NATIONS. E. Economic and Social Council. Distr. OPA/AC.33/1. 5 March 2002. Original. ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE. COORDINATING UNIT FOR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES. First Regional Forum on Youth. \"Security, Opportunity and Prosperity. Geneva, 26-28 August 2002. Information Notice. BACKGROUND. Over the last decade, the situation of youth (young people of 15-25 years old) has dramatically deteriorated in terms of health, education and employment opportunities in a large number of the UNECE countries, causing a grave concern about its well-being and about future implications of such a change. Apart from the economic decline, fundamental alterations experienced by the region, such as a socio-economic transformation of the former centrally planned economies, disintegration of states, rapid technological change and the aging of population, all have had a significant, multifaceted and often mixed impact on youth. While many young people have succeeded in coping with these changes and were able to integrate in the mainstream activities and social life, many others have not. According to the United Nations Children\\'s Fund MONEE Report, in 2000, there were almost 18 million of young people of 16-25 years old in the UNECE transition countries, who were neither in education nor in employment. The dropout rate among the secondary school students has increased and continues to grow in some countries of Central Asia and South Caucasus, indicating the decline of the prestige of education, but also the effects of poverty and income inequalities on the opportunity sets of the young people, whose families have been impoverished. The de-industrialization process observed in some countries has negatively contributed to the situation of youth, reducing the employment opportunities and narrowing carrier choices of young people. The shift of productive activities into the agricultural sector coupled with poverty has forced many families to use children and youth in household and agricultural activities at the expense of their schooling. The young adults from the urban poor families, on the other hand, have had to work in the informal sector in order to earn an additional income, therefore, leaving the school before graduation. Youth unemployment has been chronically higher than that of the adults throughout the region, exceeding the adult unemployment rate two-three times in some countries. This phenomenon has been traditionally justified by the lack of skills, work experience of the young or by the high mobility of young people at the beginning of their working life, making employers reluctant to hire young people. Another traditional explanation suggests that there is a direct relationship between the performance of economy and the scale of youth unemployment, linking the increase in youth unemployment with the lack of growth. In some recent debates, the irrelevance of youth education was also singled out as another contributing factor. From the societal perspective, regardless which of the explanations is offered, the economic, social and psychological costs of youth unemployment are enormous, especially, when considered against the trend of the aging of the population of many countries in the region. The lack or the erosion of the employability of young people requires an urgent attention from policy-makers and other agents of the civil society. Furthermore, considering some recent negative changes in youth behaviour (e.g. substance abuse and violence) induced by the stress of unemployment, social change or as a result of illicit activities of organized crime groups, the need for more active pro-youth policies and interventions to mitigate the risks of youth marginalization is of paramount importance in terms of safety and security. There are other important aspects of the current youth situation that cause concerns. These include the spread of smoking, drinking, drug abuse, risky sexual behaviour and other behaviours that aggravate the risk to the health of the young and, hence, to their capacity to work and earn decent income, in many countries of the region, including the risk of the HIV infection. The above concerns have been translated into new policy initiatives and actions at the national, regional and international levels, among which was the initiative of the United Nations General-Secretary on the creation of an international youth employment network in the partnership with all civil society agents who has a stake in the youth well-being and prosperity. The results of such initiatives in the region have been mixed with some of the countries appeared succeeding in reversing the worsening of the youth situation, while in some others failing. Most disturbing, however, is that, in a number of the UNECE member countries, facing the large-scale youth marginalization, pro-youth policies and programmes are either absent or/and unable to reach the target groups due to the lack of expertise, resources or the community\\'s involvement. There is an obvious need in disseminating the best practices and the lessons learned from the experiences in addressing the youth problems among the countries of the region from both perspectives, the humanitarian and a more pragmatic one - to undermine the social base of the organized crime, militant fundamentalism and terrorism. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE FORUM. The First Regional Forum on Youth will be organized by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in cooperation with United Nations Department for Social and Economic Affairs, the International Labour Organization, the Secretariat of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, United Nation Children\\'s Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as a follow-up to the Millennium Summit recommendations referring to the vulnerable social groups and poverty alleviation, as well as to the recommendations of the High-level Panel of the Youth Employment Network (A/54/422), the UNECE mandate to promote entrepreneurship and the development of SMEs in countries in transition, and the recommendations of the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, encouraging the United Nations Economic and Social Council to request the regional commissions, within their respective mandates and resources, to support national efforts in their respective regions in combating HIV/AIDS. The main objectives of the First Regional Forum on Youth will be as follows. to raise the awareness of the European and Central Asian constituencies about the negative trends in the youth situation in the region and their potential implications for economic development and social progress. to stimulate the debates on the youth problems. to bring the stakeholders in the youth prosperity together. to jointly look for appropriate, effective and efficient solutions. to provide an impetus to the mobilization of and a support for the affected communities. to share the experiences and lessons learned. to discuss concrete youth employment and entrepreneurship programmes and projects to be presented at the Forum; and. to adopt a regional plan of action. THE TARGET AUDIENCES. The target audiences will be the representatives of the governmental structure responsible for youth and/or labour and social welfare, and/or health, youth and other non-governmental organizations concerned with youth problems, the representatives of the United Nations agencies and intergovernmental organizations, regional and international governmental and non-governmental organizations, the representatives of the private sector and the employer associations affairs. THE EXPECTED OUTPUTS. It is expected that the Forum will energize the governments\\' efforts to remedy the situation in the mid- and long-term perspective. It is also anticipated that various partnerships between the parties concerned will be formed to augment the impact of activities aiming to re-integrate marginalized youth and to mitigate the risks threatening the future generations. Practitioners will have an opportunity to discuss the problems they have encountered in their work, exchange views and opinion about different ways and means of reducing the marginalization of youth. They will share their experiences with colleagues from other countries and with representatives of Governments and NGOs interested in acquiring technical and specific knowledge. Concrete project-proposals presented by national coordinators on youth employment and entrepreneurship from the UNECE member countries will be considered and evaluated by experts. A regional plan of action will be adopted to set up common goals, a framework for national and regional cooperative activities and benchmarking. Annex I.

First Regional Forum on Youth. \"Security, Opportunity and Prosperity. Geneva, 26-28 August 2002. FINAL REPORT. Background. The First Regional Forum on Youth was initiated and organized by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in collaboration with ILO, UNICEF, HCHR, UNAIDS, UN/DESA. Major financial contribution was made by the UNAIDS. UNDP and UNICEF also provided a support for the Forum by sponsoring the participation of the representatives of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. Each of the participating UN agencies nominated their resource persons and assisted the UNECE with bringing eminent experts to the Forum. The private sector contributed to the Forum both in kind and in cash. Swiss Media Associations organized the Round Table on the Role of ICT in Mainstreaming the Youth. The Russian ICT company, Sibintek, funded the UNECE Contest of Young Artists. As a result of this joint effort, 280 participants from 41 country and representatives of the EU, Council of Europe, NATO, CIS, Friends World Committee (Quakers), World Economic Forum, International Federation Terre des Hommes (IFTDH), YCARE International, Youth Business International, Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum, America\\' Development Foundation, W.A. de Vigier Foundation, COMMUNICARE, European Youth Forum, World Assembly of Youth and etc., as well as UNESCO, UNCTAD and the World Bank, in addition to the above organizing UN agencies, took part in the work of the Forum. Among the participants there were three State Secretaries (Romania, Hungary and Tajikistan), five deputy State Secretaries/Ministers (Russian Federation, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Slovenia), the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Family and Youth Affairs (Ukraine) and the President of National Union of Industrialists and Employers (Ukraine). Youth was represented by the Presidents of the National Youth Councils, Unions of Young Entrepreneurs, various youth societies and organizations. Other civil society organizations, including women\\'s associations, were also participating in the Forum. The UNECE secretariat prepared 3 background papers and the Information Notice for the Forum. It also created Youth Forum website with all the information on the preparation of Forum, documentation and participants\\' contributions accessible to all. The participants submitted more than 30 presentations, hard copies of which were made available during the Forum. Organization of the work of the Forum. The work of the Forum was organized as follows. Opening session was held on 26 August from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Working Groups\\' sessions from 11 a.m. to 13 p.m. and then from 15 p.m. to 18 p.m. on 26 August, and all day on 27 August. The closing session was held on 28 August from 10 a.m. to 13 p.m. Each Working Group held 5-6 panels, followed by discussion. Round Table on the Role of ICT in Mainstreaming Youth in Economic Activities was organized by the Swiss Media Association within the framework of the Working Group on Youth Entrepreneurship. In addition to the main event, the UNECE, in cooperation with the Russian ICT company \"Sibintek\", held the Young Artists\\' Contest for the Best Design of the Cover Page of the Country Assessment Reports \"Towards the Knowledge-Based Economy\". The winners of the Contest, who were able to come to Geneva, were granted the awards during the closing session of the Forum. Results of the deliberation of the Forum Working Groups. Three Working Groups were formed to have a more focused discussion of the specific risk factors and policies and measures of their alleviation. The Working Group on Youth Health and Security. Responsible UN agency: UNAIDS/UNICEF and HCHR. The Working Group on Youth Employability and Employment. Responsible UN agency: ILO and UNECE. The Working Group on Youth Entrepreneurship. Responsible UN agency: ILO and UNECE. I. Report of the Working Group on Youth Health and Security. (Secretary of the WG: Mr. A. Kahnert. The Working Group considered three issues. A. HIV/AIDS. The discussions were based on the recognition that the current situation regarding HIV/AIDS prevalence in European transition countries is alarming in terms of the growth rates of the epidemic. These growth rates are indeed unprecedented in the history of HIV/AIDS, worldwide. Prevention is at the center of countervailing strategies. Prevention methods focus on dissemination of adequate information, education of young people in schools, non-formal settings and high risk groups, and the provision of youth friendly services. Within the health services, voluntary confidential counselling and testing was identified as a very important prevention intervention. Against this background, the Working Group heard, on the one side, reports about the situation with the epidemic in individual countries, and discussed, on the other, approaches and methods used in remedial or mitigating action. Regarding reports about evidence, the Working Party listened to the particularly comprehensive report by Ms. Balakireva on the situation in Ukraine - the European country that presents, from many points of view, the most serious concerns on the continent in relation to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Another report linked the serious environmental damages in the Aral Sea region to HIV/AIDS risks of the young, arguing that the environmental disaster increases these risks, so that particular preventive efforts are warranted in environmental disaster areas. A detailed report was also made of the activities of Estonian medical students, aiming at informing and educating particularly vulnerable population groups in the country. The rights-based approach to education of young people and especially vulnerable young people (such as, sex workers, injecting drugs users, street children, men who have sex with men, ethic minority populations) and the provision of youth friendly services were highlighted, as were the life skills education and peer education schemes. It was suggested that the approaches currently in use should be complemented with empirical indicators, permitting the monitoring of the results of the approaches. Such information would particularly be valuable for those public managers, who are in charge of developing their own responses to the epidemic in their country. B. Trafficking/sexual exploitation. Evidence was presented on selected aspects, to which special risk groups are exposed - such as young refugees, youth soldiers, both men and women, and others. It was shown that all risks faced by the adults in the corresponding population groups apply to an even larger extent to the young. In view of the evidence of trafficking and sexual exploitation, response requirements were discussed in relation to a number of specific proposals. The common denominator of the proposals was that they were focusing on legal schemes. The Working Group also listened to the presentation of a comprehensive research project, with which it is hoped to embed trafficking into a cobweb of relations and links with other social processes. The ultimate aim of the project is to derive proposals for the solution of trafficking problems from an integrated and inter-disciplinary research effort into the `trafficking market\\'. C. Youth empowerment/prevention of violence. The Working Group heard an overview of the activities of an Uzbek NGO, which provides assistance to victims of domestic violence in difficult circumstances. Otherwise, youth empowerment occupied the center of the discussion. Schemes, practices and experiences were reported in relation to a number of countries and with respect to youth empowerment as well as youth policies in general. These reports triggered a free discussion about multiple aspects of the problems that are commonly encountered. The conclusions reached in this free discussion could be summarized in several ways, but three main avenues of widely agreed thinking appear to stand out. There is first of all the conviction that youth empowerment is insufficient everywhere. In this context, it was felt that a more pronounced and sustained effort could be made by the UN family to give voice to youth at their events. It was pointed out that this might also have encouraging effects for national practices in this field. The second general conclusion was to underline the necessity for specifying a `value domain\\' in youth empowerment schemes. The explicit formulation and tradition of community values were mentioned as being potentially instrumental to shaping a social identity for the young that corresponds to their wishes. The third general conclusion relates particularly to transition countries and their wider difficulties in the transition processes. Insufficient youth empowerment schemes in such countries might in fact strengthen tendencies of emigration among the young. As emigrating persons very often are qualified above the average in their native country - a circumstance sometimes enhanced by special schemes of immigration countries encouraging migratory movement of the educated - , this mechanism, to the extent it exists, tends to compromise further the medium- and long-term development prospects of their native countries. II. Report of the Working Group on Youth Employability and Employment. (Secretary of the WG: Mr. I. Adjoubei. The Working Group on Youth Employability and Employment held six panel sessions and discussed the labour market challenges for young people, ways of improving the employability, equal opportunities for youth, the role of Governments and the private sector, and the role of civil society initiatives in this area. The Working Group identified the following challenges facing the youth employment and employability. higher than average unemployment among the young people in transition economies, which holds even during the economic recovery. considerable involvement of youth in the shadow economy. a mismatch between the knowledge and skills required by enterprises and those offered by young entrants to the job market; enterprises want highly skilled workers and are reluctant to invest in training. According to ILO, young people with technical education in transition economies are in short supply, while there are too many lawyers, economists and psychologists. At the same time, the labour market often cannot absorb the supply of university graduates. absence of training in social skills. inadequate links and feedback between enterprises and educational institutions. insufficient participation of youth in decision making regarding their education and employment policy. problems associated with the globalization of economy, namely with international migration of young people from east European transition economies to the west of Europe. In particular, the persistent discrimination of young immigrants and children of immigrants is preoccupying; and. lack of descent work, that is productive and satisfying employment, decent working conditions and employment security. The above referred to challenges, which require an integrated approach to the youth employment policy. First, this policy should be integrated into the overall employment creation strategy. Second, it should be developed in conjunction with the policies related to human rights, access to education, migration, crime prevention, drug use and etc. In order to facilitate transition from school to work and reintegration of unemployed youth, the youth employment policy should include the assistance and guidance to the young job seekers, provision of adequate and timely labour market information and other services, including, if needed, access to telephones, fax machines, electronic mail, assistance in drafting resumes etc. The labour market information should include that on employment opportunities in the expanding sectors, for example, in the service economy and information and communication sector. Partnership between Governments, employers and youth associations has proved to be vital for efficient youth employment policy. This implies that the exchange of information on best national practice in this area could benefit policy-makers seeking adequate solutions to the youth employment countries in their respective countries. Partnership of all stakeholders bears fruit in both national and international employability enhancement projects. As evidenced by a number of speakers, the resource of benevolent retired private sector managers can be effectively used in this endeavour. Public policy should seek to enhance the flexibility of educational institutions as far as their curriculum is concerned. The experience shows that financial stimuli - the results-based budgeting, in particular, could be used to this end. Training aimed at strengthening the employability should be based on individual-centred methodologies and informal ways of learning. The basis of employability includes, amongst other, the so-called \"soft skills\": literacy, numerical skills, communication and the capacity to get to work on time. It also includes social skills, needed for communication. Core competencies of the youth, entering the job market, should incorporate as well the labour market navigation skills. When discussing equal opportunities for various categories of youth, the Working Group agreed that disadvantaged youth, which included among other the disabled, homeless, drug and alcohol addicts, single mothers, discriminated national minorities and immigrants, are in need of an early support, ensuring that they have the minimal skills, enabling their integration into the labour force. It is against this background their vocational training could be successful. One of the methods of the vocational training of the disadvantage young people is mentoring, which enables a personal and individualized relationship between the adviser/coach and the job seeker. It was also emphasized that the impact of programmes is enhanced, when they reach out to deprived communities. Governments contribute to employability through establishing a regulatory basis for employment; undertaking targeted programmes of youth employment promotion; and cooperating with all the stakeholders, including the private sector and youth representatives. A number of speakers from transition economies (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine) informed the meeting of their Govenrments\\' efforts to promote the employability of youth. The Working Group agreed that to be effective the government programmes of youth employment should be coordinated not only with the overall employment policies, but also with regional, ecological and industrial restructuring policies. Several participants drew the attention of the Group to the financial constraints, inhibiting an active Government youth policy. In this area, a number of transition economies seek assistance from international financial institutions and other donors. Despite this handicap, several transition countries have taken diversified and effective measures to improve vocational guidance, educational and training tailored to market demand. These measures are supplemented by social protection schemes in respect of new labour market entrants. The Working Group agreed that a timely evaluation and performance measurement of labour market programmes is a prerequisite of their success. While several transition countries (e.g. Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland) do perform such a programme evaluation, a number of delegates requested assistance, including the methodological assistance, from the international organizations in addressing this issue. The Working Group discussed the experience of countries with the so-called \"dual system\" of vocational training, which combines formal education with apprenticeship, and noted its positive role in facilitating the school to work transition and career preparation. The applicability of this system elsewhere is determined by country-specific social and other conditions. The Working Group agreed on the usefulness of occupational forecasting for the purpose of enhanced employability. To be effective, macroeconomic forecasts and modelling should be supplemented by a detailed examination of sectoral occupational trends. The Working Group also discussed the role of civil society institutions, and that of youth organizations, in particular. Youth organizations contribute to employability through trying to influence government policies and programmes; and through implementing their own projects. In this latter case, they provide a feedback to decision-makers, which could be used in elaborating or adjusting policies. As an example, the European Employment Strategy was developed in consultation and with participation of the European Youth Council. A number of youth organizations informed the Group on the ongoing projects aimed at developing employability of youth both in their countries and abroad (in developing countries). These include, for example, projects, providing possibilities of vocational training, developing entrepreneurship and self-employment (youth villages) in rural areas and implementing temporary employment schemes in the period of summer vacations (\"students\\' construction detachments\"). In highlighting factors behind the success of those projects, they emphasized the necessity of cooperation with local authorities, enterprises, banks and industrial associations. Finally, the Working Group discussed and agreed on the importance of non-formal education as a factor of employability. Different views were expressed regarding the need for formal recognition of skills and competencies acquired though this type of education. III. The Working Group on Youth Entrepreneurship. (Secretary: Mr. A. Szabo. The Working Group on Youth Entrepreneurship carried out four Panels on the following subjects. Entrepreneurship as a Means to Alleviate Property, chaired by Ms. Rachel Golden, Vice-Chairperson of the UNECE Team of Specialists on Entrepreneurship in Poverty Alleviation. Learning to be Entrepreneurial, Government Youth Entrepreneurship Initiative, chaired by Mr. Antal Szabo, Regional Adviser on Entrepreneurship and SMEs of the UNECE. Youth Entrepreneurship Programme: Private Sector and NGO Initiatives, chaired by Mr. Jan Elofsson, Vice-President of the Swedish COMMUNICARE; and. Youth Entrepreneurship Programme: Partnership Approach, chaired by Mr. Duncan Campbell, Head of the Employment Policy Unit of the ILO. During the discussion of the above issues, the participants referred to growing difficulties faced by young people in their attempt to enter the labour market and to earn a decent income. They identified a number of processes, which, in their view, have impacted income opportunities for youth in the region. These are: unfinished transition towards a market economy; EU enlargement; globalization; the aging of the population, and, finally, a rapid technological change, and expressed concern that most policy options targeting youth appeared ineffective in providing a lasting solution. Some of the participants expressed doubts about the effect of a noticeable effort by many Governments to channel young people to the SME sector. According to some country studies, average survival rate of the SMEs created by young entrepreneurs is only 10-15 per cent. A more profound approach to the youth current problems is needed to reduce the risk of poverty, and, therefore, recruitment of young people by illegal and informal businesses, including drug dealers, which has been on rise in some of the countries of the region. In many countries in transition, according to the participants, Governments appear either underestimating the magnitude of youth problems and, therefore, remain passive, or lacking adequate resources to provide an effective support of youth entrepreneurship and employment generation. This is confirmed by the facts that, in some countries, the responsibility for youth affairs is spread among different Government agencies, while in some other countries, the specialized Ministries or agencies responsible for youth affairs do not receive resources adequate enough to support any significant youth programme, which could make a difference. Participants called upon the UN organizing agencies, the donor community and the private sector to provide expertise and assistance in the area of youth entrepreneurship, especially, with the view of how to increase the survival rate of young entrepreneurs. They expressed interest in learning about successful approaches, programmes, schemes and tools to promote youth entrepreneurship, as well as in building partnerships with organizations from other countries. Innovative Government policies to promote youth entrepreneurship were presented during the panel on Government and Private Sector Initiatives. Presentations were made by the Government representatives of Hungary, Slovenia and Ukraine. They emphasized the role of the Government in the creation of a favourable institutional environment for the development of entrepreneurship and SMEs. According to Mrs. Róza Nagy, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Economy and Transport of Hungary, 99% of all enterprises in the country are SMEs. There are 63 enterprises per 1000 inhabitants in the country, while the EU average is 52. There are 800,000 enterprises, and the majority of these are sole proprietors. SMEs play important role in the economy, generating about 50 % of the GDP. The newly elected Government, understanding the importance of SMEs, launched a new programme and innovative policy instruments to reinforce the SME sector. To assist SMEs to overcome financial constraints, the new programme envisages to introduce lending scheme, credit guarantees, and a special credit card for the owners of SMEs. It also contains a special set of measures aiming to facilitate youth entrepreneurship. In Slovenia, the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Education and Sport, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economy elaborated a Programme of the Development of Entrepreneurship and Creativity among Young People. By supporting this Programme, the participating Ministries have been able to stimulate the development of entrepreneurship and the enterprise creation in their respective fields. The Small Business Development Centre, a public organization, which carries out public tenders for selecting subcontractors, coordinates the Action Programme. The Head of the Department for Family and Youth Affairs of the State Committee of Ukraine informed the participants about the difficult situation of the youth in Ukraine, where 38% of all the registered unemployed are below 28 years. The formal SME sector is largely underdeveloped and contributes only 7% of the GDP. One out of seven young people are employed in the informal sector. The self-confidence of the youth has been decreasing. However, according to a study conducted by the State Committee, 40% of the youth would like to become entrepreneurs and run their business legally. The State Committee for Regulatory Policy and Support of Small Entrepreneurs elaborated a three-year Programme for Support of Youth Entrepreneurship. This is based on the social partnership between Government and youth organizations. The Programme has two years experiences so far. It is implemented by a newly created organization: the Youth Centre of Ukraine. The Government also created youth job centres in 20 regions in Ukraine. One of the programmes is oriented towards the development of entrepreneurial activities in rural areas. The panel on the Private Sector and Non-government Initiatives revealed a growing involvement of the corporate and non-government sector in addressing the problems of youth, therefore, indicating a huge potential for joint action been ignored so far by many Governments. Below are some most successful stories of such initiatives presented at the panel. The Young Entrepreneurs Scheme (YES) in Ireland aims at developing self-confidence & self-esteem amongst second level students between 12 and 18 years of age. Students are entering YES because of its challenge, thrill of selling, earning money and obtaining recognition. In Ireland, with a population of 4 million, about 60,000 second/level students have already set up a business through YES. A pilot programme was also introduced in Estonia. The Swedish COMMUNICARE (Do together) is a non-profit organization aiming to change the attitude of young people from disadvantaged groups through local offices for developing a good society and with a methodology of \"young leads young\". Since April 2002, 30,304 contacts were made and 204 young people started their own business. The Programme \"Young Talents\" was developed by a non-profit organization, International Investment Centre in Yaroslavl, the Russian Federation, without any Government support. So far, 500 new jobs were created. All three initiatives have been successful. The speakers emphasized the importance of the models tailored to the local conditions. They also underscored the importance of participation of the target groups in developing such models. In their view, much of the success have to be attributed to the creativity of the young people involved in the process, as well as to the approach, which initially starts with the development of self-esteem, as well as the volunteering of mentors. In his presentation, the Director of the Youth Business International (YBI), Member of the Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum, put a strong emphasis on partnership approach. He emphasized, that there exists a significant gap between the provision of skill training and business planning, on one hand, and the provision of financial and enterprise support, on the other one. YBI intention is to bridge this gap. According to the YBI approach, business support for young entrepreneurs should be based on (i) voluntary business mentoring: (ii) pro bono advice: (iii) links to other businesses and networks: and (iv) provision of training/technical advices. Since 1993, over 60,000 young people were helped, and 60% of all businesses are still trading in their third years. The YBI is a charity organization with a revolving fund with nearly 70% recovery rate. The representative of the ILO informed the participants about a recent initiative of the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to form a High-Level Panel on Youth Employment Network, and invited the most creative leaders of the private sector, economic policy-making and civil society (including youth leaders) to join the panel to explore imaginative approaches to the youth employment challenge. The network is expected to develop recommendations on possible sources of solutions, including the contribution that information technology and the informal sector could make in employment generation. The Secretary-General\\'s Youth Employment Network will make recommendations and provide a guideline to a range of actions that would be implemented to improve the position of young people in the labour market. One of the recommendations is devoted to youth entrepreneurship. Mr. Duncan Campbell, Head of the Employment Policy Unit of the ILO, briefed the participants about this initiative and called governments and NGOs to join this Network. A graduated student from the University of Debrecen of Hungary, representing a youth society, drew the attention of the participants to the fact that many young people with higher-education face difficulties in finding jobs. Even in the advanced countries in transition, it is difficult to find a job for a graduated student, because large companies and multinationals find them either lacking work experience (usual demand of 2-3 year-work experience) or overqualified. It is also impossible to get a start-up practice because of the lack of incentives for companies. Even having an entrepreneurial management training, it is difficult to start-up own businesses, because of the lack of collateral and initial capital. In her view, Governments have to help to overcome these obstacles, which most of the graduate students are facing before even starting their career. The President of the World Youth Bank Organizing Committee informed the participants about the decision of the World Assembly of Youth to create an universal financial intermediary for channelling all financial resources oriented towards youth entrepreneurship. In the next ten years 1.2 billion of young women and man will enter the working age population, the best educated and trained generation of young people ever. Investing into the future is of paramount importance, because we have \"One World of Tomorrow\". An independent consultant and trainer of the Swiss TrainLing Company emphasized the basic human principles and values, as well as the worth of verbal communication skills, for to be an entrepreneur. In his view, the collapse of the US Enron company highlighted the importance of bringing back the business ethics. Large enterprises should show good examples for SMEs and especially start-ups. He suggested that any education and training system should be based on an \"integrated education\", which means to keep the BALANCE between the TECHNICAL, (computer, etc.) knowledge and skills and the HUMAN, (interpersonal verbal communication, etc.) knowledge and skills. It is true, that we are going into the electronic age, however, it is also true that we would remain human creatures. In their conclusion and recommendations, the participants underlined the following. 1. Youth programme are new initiatives of the Government not only in countries in transition, but also in advanced market economies. Ministries for Youth Affairs in are new structures without significance experience. In the majority of cases, there is lack of co-operation between the Government authorities, which are responsible for economic development, entrepreneurship development, education, and those, which are responsible for youth affairs. Governments are encouraged to create intergovernmental bodies responsible for youth programme, including those on young entrepreneurship. Governments should elaborate action plans taking into consideration the recommendations of the Youth Employment Network. 2. Due to the fact that little is known about the effects of Government youth policies and programmes, the participants recommended that in the follow-up to the Forum a special effort should be undertake to organize the exchange of experiences in the area of youth entrepreneurship. Systematic data collection on youth enterprises by age and gender and benchmarking of the development of youth entrepreneurship very much recommended. International foundations and youth development programmes, such as the Prince of Wales Foundation Business Leaders Forum, COMMUNICARE, YES, Kiev Youth Business Centre, International Investment Centre, SBDC, and others, were invited to elaborate a benchmarking and evaluation methodology in order to capture the impact of youth entrepreneurship policies and programmes on youth. 3. Participants emphasized, that the best way of poverty alleviation among the young generation is to encourage the development of indigenous entrepreneurship and to provide a supportive environment for the SME creation and evolution. 4. It was recommended that Governments should carry out a dialogue with large enterprises and multinational companies in order to identify measures to improve the access of the newly graduated students to jobs. 5. The UNECE was advised to investigate the possibility of creating a special website for young entrepreneurs. Round Table on the Role of ICT in Mainstreaming of Youth. The Round Table organized by the Swiss Media Association brought together experts in e-learning, e-teaching, e-training, e-human resources management, representatives of the private sector, education establishment and policy - makers from Switzerland, Korea, Russian Federation, France, Germany and Ukraine. In their presentations, panelists emphasized that the most important pre-condition for the information technologies to release their potential and for the societies to fully capture social and economic benefits associated with these technologies is the willingness, commitment and determination of the Governments to make this happens. Technologies are a means, a tool, which, depending on the existing environment, may have either a limited and/or differentiating effect in terms of income distribution, or, on the contrary, may significantly empower all the social groups, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of the society, widening their access to income opportunities. Examples, which were highlighted by some of the panelists, showed that even illiterate people could benefit from these technologies, including the acquisition of literacy. Many software programmes, which were presented at the Round Table, are able to augment the users in terms of their learning capability, knowledge, information, as well as in terms of economic gains. Programmes and schemes, successfully implemented by Korea, Switzerland, as well as by some of the participating companies in Africa and Asia, have demonstrated, that information technologies may be used anywhere with a minimum support. However, if the issue of access remains unresolved in some of the countries of the UNECE region in the immediate future, this would lead to the formation of a new division, the first- and the second-class citizens, those having the access and those deprived of it. Therefore, the Governments have a crucial role to play in ensuring that these new technologies are accessible to all. The participants also presented cases of successful youth entrepreneurship schemes, which involve various stages of the ICT development and application, from software design, content provision, programming to wholesale/retail. However, as it was undermined by the Director of the Foundation de Vigier Entrepreneurship, key pre-conditions of success are a preliminary screening of business ideas and the availability of seed money to ensure that young entrepreneurs are provided with a start-up capital. Recommendations of the Forum. Apart from the specific recommendations made during the deliberations of the Working Groups, the participants of the Forum made the following recommendations. Request a joint Secretariat of the UN organizing agencies to draft a regional plan of action, which should be send to all the Ministries responsible for youth affairs and organizations, which participated in the Forum, for contribution and comments. In preparing a draft plan of action, the joint Secretariat is recommended to make sure that all the three goals of the Forum (security, opportunity and prosperity of youth), which are horizontal aspects, are taken into consideration and, therefore, its implementation will result in alleviation of all the risk cited factors and the vulnerability of youth in the region. Recommend the draft regional plan of action being submitted for consideration, including possible means and way of its implementation, by a joint meeting of the Ministers for Youth Affairs and National Youth Councils to be held in the first quarter of the year 2003. Recommend conveying the Second Regional Forum on Youth in 2004, ensuring that all the countries of the region are fully represented. Recommend other UN Regional Commissions to organize similar regional Forums on Youth with the UNECE First Regional Forum as a model. Invite ESCAP and ESCWA and ECA to consider the possibility of joining some of the UNECE sub-regional programmes aiming to facilitate the development of youth e-commerce. Invite the private sector to actively participate in national, sub- and regional youth programmes and projects on the partnership basis. Request the joint Secretariat to address the Governments of the UNECE member States, calling upon them to support activities and initiatives, aiming to promote youth employment and youth entrepreneurship, and/or to develop specific national policies and policy instruments. Call upon all the relevant UN agencies and bodies to continue their cooperation in promoting youth employment and youth entrepreneurship in the UNECE region. Call upon Governments and all relevant UN agencies and bodies to provide better targeted actions with regards to the employability of youth in general with specific attention towards youth in disadvantaged situations. Invite the donor community to consider the possibility of providing a financial support for youth employment and entrepreneurship projects and programmes, initiated in countries in transition, including those based on the partnership approach and joint youth ventures. Request the joint Secretariat of the UN organizing agencies to identify a possibility of developing and funding sub-regional projects on ICT in Mainstreaming Youth in Economic Activities, including from the UN Development Account. Recommend establishing a UNECE group of experts for screening project proposals made by the participants of the Forum in order to form a portfolio of bankable projects to be presented to international financial institutions, bilateral development assistance agencies, corporate and other private foundations for funding. Request the UNECE to organize a workshop in sub-regions on Best Practices in Generating Youth Employment and Self-employment Opportunities and on How to Increase the Survival Rate of SMEs Owned by Young Entrepreneurs, giving a special attention to youth in declining industrial areas and possibilities of utilizing its potential in their recovery. Request the UNECE to initiate a systematic collection of data on youth entrepreneurship and to prepare a compendium of best practices in ensuring the sustainability of business set up by young entrepreneurs. Request the UNECE to study the possibility of developing a PPP youth entrepreneurship programme for the South-East European sub-region or within the framework of SECI to be submitted for consideration/funding by the Stability Pact, the EU, EBRD and the World Bank. Request the UNECE to study the feasibility of creating youth banks in the region, drawing upon the expertise available in the UN system, regional and international financial institutions. ',\n",

They include regional, city and district state administrations, ministries, departments, enterprises, firms and individuals, etc. Essential help has been given to the Fund by the Embassies of Bulgaria, the Vatican, Georgia, Spain, Italy, China and France. The National Fund is one of the main organizations in Ukraine that promotes the national policy of social protection for mothers and children. It supports hospitals, boarding schools, and children\\'s homes. The scope of charitable assistance clearly demonstrates the National Fund\\'s work. During its five years of existence the National Fund has assisted boarding schools, children\\'s homes, hospitals, disabled children, orphans, underpriviledged families and families with many children by providing of clothes, equipment, motor transport, foodstuffs and other goods to the amount of 7.3 mln. hrivnas ($ 1.4 mln.).

Medical institutions were given 34 devices for ultrasonic research, 800 acoustic devices, 25 delivery tables for newborn children, 23 cars, and 30 computers. Four boarding schools have been fully equipped with computer rooms. Creating the possibility for the young generation to become proficient in modern information technologies is especially important in our century of scientific and technological advance. Thanks to the Fund children have had the possibility to reveal their abilities. They have received access to modern technological systems including Internet. Together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the Fund has provided 26 computers to boarding-school institutions for orphans. Computer rooms were opened in the city of Lubary (Zhitomyr region), secondary school (\"gymnasia\") № 17 in Vinnitsa, boarding schools in the city of Camenets-Podolsk and in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. As a result, Roma Ivanov who became an orphan when he was two years old is now getting higher education. Mariyka Prihodko who was certified as a retarded child, attended Kirovograd College, has mastered English and showed her worth in the collective as a leader. Every year, the National Fund favours children with the Holiday of the New Year Tree that takes place in all regional centres of Ukraine. Together with presents, children receive the affection and kindness of generous-hearted people that is so important for inmates of children\\'s homes, boarding schools and other children\\'s institutions that are lacking family happiness. It has become a tradition to celebrate Child Protection Day which is generally considered as the main children`s holiday. In 2001, in the framework of this holiday, the Ukrainian festival of youth fashion was held. One of the National Fund\\'s priorities is support for the creation of popular children\\'s TV and radio programmes and projects of children\\'s publications. The National Fund cooperates with a creative group on the children\\'s children\\'s programme \"Journey to Childhood\". This programme travels to the world of children\\'s dreams, fantasies, and creations and at the same time it is preparation for real life in the grown-up world. Children\\'s problems, successes and misfortunes are discussed in this programme. Youth and children have the possibility to learn many interesting things while reading the Ukrainian magazine \"Comics\". With the assistance of the National Fund, a charitable subscription to \"Bolshaya detskaya gazeta\" (the Big Children\\'s Newspaper) was provided to children\\'s homes and boarding-schools in different regions of Ukraine. The importance of gifted personalities in the social and political development of the state is priceless. As a young state, Ukraine pays a lot of attention to the development of gifted children and youth that are the intellectual potential of the nation. The support of gifted children is the best investment in the future. This includes the creation of conditions for discovering abilities, development of children and youth\\'s talents, and their intellectual and creative potential. The programme \"Gifted children\" is a contribution of the National Fund to the implementation of the provisions of the National Programme \"Children of Ukraine\" and the programme of work with gifted youth in 2001 - 2005, approved by the Decrees of the President of Ukraine. Personalities are born in creative work. Ukrainian festivals, contests, competitions, charitable concerts, and music holidays give children unforgettable holidays and the possibility to realize their abilities. They promote the intellectual and cultural development of children. The National Fund supports children\\'s participation in international contests, festivals, and student competitions. As messengers of peace and kindness children open up Ukraine to the world, showing the best of its original culture and art. The beauty of Ukrainian songs amazed audiences at the International Music Festival in Llangollen (UK). Young creators had the possibility to display their skills during festivals that took place in Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, France and Bulgaria. In addition, they were given an excellent opportunity to have a wonderful rest. Young talents from Russia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, USA, Japan, Taiwan, China and many other countries took part in the contest of young pianists dedicated to the memory of Vladimir Gorovits, a festival of music that was held in Kiev with the National Fund\\'s support. The National Fund for the Social Protection of Mothers and Children \"Ukraine for Children\" offers cooperation with international, governmental and non-governmental organizations, children\\'s funds and entrepreneurs with the aim of ensuring the prosperity of children and youth, creating the conditions for their harmonious development and finding their place in civil society.

Ukraine - the young state, which exists only eleven years. During all existence of our state there is a process of gradual transition from a post totalitarian society to the civil European state in which the youth takes an active part. The youth always personified the future of mankind at the same time, trying to accept participation in life of a society, young people, on the one hand, as soon as possible try to be entered in the existing order, to socialize. On the other hand, as the basic human resource of development of the country, carry out a role of driving force that gravitates to transformations of order, is a conductor of social changes, economic development and technical process. The creative imagination, ideals, energy and potential of young people have the important value for maintenance of constant development of a society they live. Problems with which young people faced, and also their aspiration and hopes are main of the basic tasks and prospects of development of present society, and the future generations. All this constantly demands necessity of development and realization of new actions and programs for implementing of a youth policy at all levels. Rates of optimization of social and economic conditions of life both present, and the future generations depend on effective solving of its problems and realization of potential opportunities of youth. Unfortunately, today the youth not always may realize the potential due to absence of mechanisms of realization of knowledge and the skills acquired during training; insufficient financial, legal and information support of young businessmen from the central and local authorities. The project is actual and necessary for an embodiment as formation of new generation of the young people, capable to accept responsible decisions, is a part of the state youth policy and professionalism of the future politicians and businessmen will depend on it in Ukraine. The project is prepared and accepted August, 7 2002 by the joint decision of participants - executors of the project which are specified in section \"Other cooperating organizations, and coordinated with the Committee of Supreme Council of Ukraine on questions of a youth policy, physical training, sports and tourism, and also the State Committee of Ukraine on affairs of Family and Youth. 2. THE DESCRIPTION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION/CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT. In modern conditions there is a difficult situation with youth in Ukraine: complex economic conditions, change of relations and forms of ownership, slump in production in the industry and agrarian sector, adverse ecological conditions. All this has caused the main problem - young people constantly face with complexity in realization of the knowledge and abilities. According to statistics, more than 30 % of youth in Ukraine - unemployed (by independent public organization is much more), from them - 40 % have higher education. On the end of 2001 in our country there were 3, 2 million representatives only small business, not considering tens thousand average and large enterprises. Only 5 % of persons in the age of 18 - 28 years are engaged in enterprise activity. 40 % of youth want to engage in enterprise activity. Unfortunately, shortage of necessary knowledge on questions of the legislation, tax system and legal questions, absence of vital system of support of business, constrain development of youth business. Besides, in Ukraine there is a critical situation with health of young people. Almost 90 percents of children, pupils and students have a deviation in health, over 50 percents - unsatisfactory physical preparation, including at the age of 16-19 years - 61 percent, 20-29 years - 67, 2 percents. Only during last years has sharply increased number of the student\\'s and pupil\\'s youth which It is referred to special medical group. At the same period the group of risk among the most active part of young people increases as the result the number of the minors who have been instituted criminal proceedings has considerably grown to 63 percents. Teenagers make almost each tenth crime in Ukraine. The minors that use drugs have increased to 60 percents. All this has resulted in deterioration of a physical and mental condition of the most impressionable part of the population - youth, and has had an effect in significant increase of cardiovascular, oncological, mental and other diseases among young people, has caused of intensification of smoking, alcoholism, narcotics etc. Above-mentioned problems of development and the negative social consequences caused by them have convinced organizers of the project, using the saved up experience before the carried out programs to develop the project covering territory of all country, in view of geographical, economic, socio-cultural features of regions. The Concept of the submitted project - \"Youth Business of Ukraine\" consists of. · to open potential of youth. · to show alternatives, opportunity and a way of the decision of essential problems of youth; and. · to learn and support at a stage of becoming and development of own business. 3. PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED. low level of public and social activity of youth, absence of majority the feeling of the social responsibility and direct participation in the decision of problems of the country. low level of information-methodical supplying of high schools of regions, absence of materials on actual youth problems. absence of possibilities of training through a network of the industrial practice enterprises with the purpose of granting practical administrative experience of youth. high level of unemployment, especially in regions. absence of supporting of small and middle business that caused mass exit of young businessmen from business. formation of new generation of young people ( politicians and businessmen in future), capable to make the decision and to bear the responsibility for destiny of the country. social vulnerability of youth. 4.

As researches have shown, the Ukrainian youth disturbed with such social aspects: employment, support in development of own business, a problem of training, and shortage of information and a high level of unemployment, especially in regions of the country. The project provides work on three directions. 1. Youth business. 2. Training and employment of youth. 3. Propagation of a healthy way of life. Each item of the given programme includes actions as All-Ukrainian and regional value. Youth entrepreneurship. The orientation of the project on support of youth business is caused by the following reasons: absence of working mechanism of realization of a state policy in the plan for development of small business, support of beginning businessmen, absence of necessary legal maintenance of development of business in the country, limitation or full absence of financial resources at a stage of creation etc. With the purpose of support and encouragement of beginning businessmen, attraction of youth to enterprise activity we provide All-Ukrainian competition of business - plans among youth. The first stage of competition is realization of regional rounds and registration of participants. As young businessmen frequently do not have necessary knowledge and experience of enterprise activity, during competition there are training seminars, trainings and consultations on actual questions of business. At the third stage Commission of experts, carry out competitive selection of participants. The fourth stage of the organization is realization of the final of competition, and as a result, rewarding of winners and granting of support in realization of projects. Attraction of all regions for participation in competition and expansion of the program of training seminars and trainings in small cities of the country will be considered as positive result. The following action for development of youth business is the organization of a competition - nomination \"The youth entrepreneur of the year\". Realization of competition is preceded with distribution of the information to MASS MEDIA, networks Internet, and registration of participants and competitive selection. Granting of awards to winners is carried out in solemn conditions at wide illumination in mass media with the purpose of increase of the status and formation of positive image of the young entrepreneur. Separate direction of the project is organization of All-Ukrainian competitions \"The best programmer\" and \"The best mathematic\" with the purpose of revealing and support of talented young specialists and development of priority fields of computerization and mathematical science. Organization and adjustment of cooperation with the international organizations engaged in this issue with the purpose of information interchange, acquiring of a foreign operational experience in the given sphere is also supposed. For adjustment of connections between young entrepreneurs, youth organizations, increase of a level of public activity of youth, we plan to realize All-Ukrainian and regional conferences and Forums on questions of youth business, employment and formation of youth. There are some stages in the organization of regional conferences. 1. Acquaintance with a situation in regions and definition of areas in which most sharply there is a problem of unemployment and attraction of youth to small business. 2. Realization of spadework, creation of material base in the appropriate regions. 3. Realization of conference and distribution of methodical materials among participants. Realization of such conferences and forums gives an opportunity to youth of search of new contacts, the useful information, exchange of experience, imparts skills of management, gives an opportunity to realize the potential and to accept active participation in the decision of essential social and economic problems. With the purpose of increase of a level of knowledge of young businessmen in conditions of transformation of a society provides preparation and the edition of a series of handbooks for the young businessmen revealing most actual questions of business, and also development and creation of WEB-site \" Business - alternative of Ukraine\\'s youth\" that will give full access of interested youth to the information about provided actions assisting development of youth business. It is planned to create the centre of assistance to the youth farmers supplying a number of agricultural and leasing services in direction of development of agro-business and youth farmers. As the project includes actions not only All-Ukrainian, but also regional value, organizers of the project carried out a social and economic estimation of oblasts. As analysis has shown, the most crisis situation has developed in the Donbass region (Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts). It means, that the given region first of all needs realization of social actions with the purpose of support and development of youth business and youth as such. Substantiation. In Donbass lives 1 654 739 of youth at the age of 14-28 years that makes 15% to the total number of the young population in Ukraine. Number of youth of Donbass on a residence. (according to Goskomstat on 01.01.2001. Population. Number of youth. In % to all population of region. All. City. Donetsk. Lugansk. Thus the total factor of birth rate in region makes 0,9 and is the lowest parameter in Ukraine. A natural increase in population of region is negative (approximately -1), that means the tendency of ageing of the population of Donbass. The material aspect pays more attention: incomes of youth of region on a background of all-ukrainian incomes are at very low level. So, the average monthly income of young people of Donbass approximately makes 45-47 grivnas (equivalent to $ 8-9 ), that is almost twice less, than in Ukraine as a whole. The low level of material security of families of region influences not only physical health of youth, but also essentially limits opportunities of young people for acquiring of the vocational training, the appropriate qualification, forces to choose such kind of activity which provides only primitive models of a survival. Thus a significant part of youth of region for many reasons (absence of professional - educational preparation, a problem of employment) has no personal incomes at all. Compelled unemployment among youth and the female population is one of the sharpest social and economic problems of the given region. Oblast(region. Number of unemployed, people. Including. Women. Youth till 28 years. Luhansk. It is necessary to note, that the Donetsk oblast has the highest level of unemployment in Ukraine, including youth and women. One of the reasons of unemployment in the region is the out-of-date material base of educational establishments, the industrial enterprises, mines, that in turn conducts to their closing, and as consequence, increases number of the unemployed people in the region. These circumstances entail the big outflow of the young population of region to other oblasts and abroad. According to statistics, among total number of the youth working abroad most of all are natives of Donbass. Complication of social and economic situation, a low standard of living in region, fall of moral standards and values in a society negatively influence health of youth and promote distribution of the negative phenomena in the region, including the use drugs, alcohol by young people , increase of a crime rate among youth. On the given phenomena the region has the highest parameters in Ukraine. Taking into account an urgency of social and economic problems of Donbass, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine accepted the Law of Ukraine On special economic zones and a special mode of investment activity in the Donetsk oblast, providing complex of actions for re-structuring the enterprises of region (realization of the organizational and economic, legal, technical actions directed on change of structure of the enterprise, its management, a form of ownership with the purpose of financial improvement of the enterprise, increase of volumes of competitive production, the organization of new workplaces, increase of efficiency of manufactures), reprofiling of the enterprises (change of technology of production for release of new production, or modernization of production which was issued at this enterprise earlier). The present situation in the region and presence of a plenty of social and economic problems of Donbass does not allow to solve the problems of youth in a due measure. Organizers of the project have solved to allocate separately in the project a problem of Donbass. Besides actions of All-Ukrainian character which will be carried out in this region, it is supposed also to implement the following. Organization of the Centre of support of youth business \"Young Donbass\", giving consultations on the basic problems of business. Creation on the basis of HIGH SCHOOLS of region of three student business - clubs with the purpose of revealing of the most active youth with organizing abilities, encouragements and stimulations of youth initiatives, attraction of youth to work in entrepreneurship environment, to the decision of the certain tasks of business, and also creation of youth business- structures. Realization of stage-by-stage work with young businessmen. Organization and realization of training on business - planning for young businessmen and young specialists. Granting of consultations in legal aspects of business (registration of the enterprise, registration of the appropriate documents etc.). Rendering assistance to young businessmen in the organization of their own business on a basis of business - plans qualitatively prepared by them and other documents with help of microcredits, granting the necessary equipment in leasing. Realization of special seminars with problem youth with the purpose of increase of moral culture, education moral and spiritual values of youth. Organization and realization of ecological seminars on protection of environment in a view of a high level of pollution, a gassed condition and a dust content of the Donbass region. Priority direction in realization of support of young entrepreneurship is the Project of development of legal sphere \"Future Begins Today\", providing creation of analytical group from among young economists, lawyers and politicians. Strategy of transition to market economy in our country and as consequence, shortage of experience in market conditions has caused presence of defects in the legislation, the policy, which is carried out by bodies of the government, and in the system of preparation of the future staff. All this demands the full and deep analysis with the purpose of forecasting an economic, political and social situation in the country, which may develop in the future. Who needs such analysis, how not young generation of specialists? We may predict so to prevent those consequences, which are entailed by not always correct policy of the state, and overproduction by high schools of experts in some areas of a science that conducts to increase of a rate of unemployment among youth, including latent. Result of work of analytical group is preparation and the edition of the analytical report on prospects of the Ukrainian economy for the nearest 20 years, its distribution among all population, and among representatives of the government.

Necessity of realization of the program \"Personnel reserve of Ukraine\" connected with absence of system of selection and helping to young experts.

Thus, there is a need of creation of the Uniform information database of the best young and capable managers and businessmen of Ukraine with the purpose of rational use of organizational and administrative resources of the citizens for successful development of national economy.

Perceptions about Youth Entrepreneurship. Many young people believe that once they are given enough resources, they could easily establish and successfully run a business enterprise. So, they perceive that the major obstacle to their entrepreneurial activity is the lack of funding. Although the lack of collateral prevents many young people from starting-up their own businesses, the experience, however, shows that this is only a part of the problem. The potential of the business idea, in terms of the existing and future demand for products or services, is of great importance as well. The idea itself does matter. Opinions, however, with regards to which of the ideas embodies that true one business idea widely vary. Some young people think that it should represent a high-tech innovation. Some other suggests that it should be a kind of strategic vision, while others believe that it should be very unique. In reality, many successful business ideas, which brought a fortune to their holders, were very simple, but they have one thing in common - these ideas provided a solution to a community\\'s need or problem by producing a new service or product. Similar diversity of opinions exists on the issue of which characteristics are attributable to the true entrepreneur. The interesting side of this issue is that no single characteristic or description explains an entrepreneur. There are many different kinds of entrepreneurs. Some types could be distinguished as follows. Technical entrepreneurs. These individuals have a strong technical orientation. They love inventing things and developing ideas for new products. Developing new markets and even new industries are generally the goal of those with technical orientation. The creation of an enterprise is merely a means to achieving their goals, not an end in itself. These are people like Henry Ford or Herbert Edwin Land, the inventor of anti-glare plastic sheets and camera filters, and the founder of Polaroid Company. Organization builders. Some entrepreneurs start their own businesses because they like to build organizations. These organization builders have skills in developing people, systems and structures. These are people like Lee Iacocca, who saved the Chrysler Corporation from collapse during the 1980s, or Ray Croc, who build the McDonalds franchise chain, the largest in the World. Deal makers. Dear makers enjoy making the initial deal to start a new venture and often enjoy some start-up activities. However, unlike the organization builders, they dislike having to manage and commit themselves to an organization over the long run. These are people, who are usually involved in financial or trade transactions. Apart from the business idea, an entrepreneur needs specific skills and knowledge to be able to operate his or her enterprise on daily basis. This aspect of entrepreneurial activity tends to be ignored by young people. Entrepreneurship is a dynamic process, which requires certain skills and knowledge. It is both a science and an art. Science must be learned through training, but managing an enterprise is an art, which could be learned, at least partially, by doing. Young people, aspiring to become entrepreneurs, need to be trained in business management, marketing, financing and accounting, human resources management and informational technologies. They also need to learn legal and fiscal aspects of business. Finally, it is important that would-be-entrepreneurs become familiar not only with the potential benefits, but also with possible risks entrepreneurs have to face and about the trade-offs they have to make. Apparently, the biggest risk entrepreneurs usually face not at the initial stage of starting up their businesses, but rather later, after the business established itself and has to be developed further. This aspect needs to be taken into consideration not only by would-be-entrepreneurs, but also by organizations, which provide services for young entrepreneurs. The UNECE has developed a guide to help start-ups and advanced entrepreneurs to understand and cope with business risks (see UNECE documentation: http://www.unece.org/indust/sme/ece-sme.htm). Policies and Programmes. Over the last decade, policies and programme promoting youth entrepreneurship have become rather widespread. To some extent, this was a response to persistently high youth unemployment in all the countries of the UNECE region with the exception of a few. This was also a response to a number of developmental trends, which were causing a concern about the future supply of jobs. One of such trends has been a shift in the allocation of labour away from the large-scale, heavily concentrated industrial production towards the service and small-scale production sectors. Another relevant trend has been a gradual re-arrangement of labour relations from relatively secure forms to more precarious ones with prevailingly short- or fixed-term contractual arrangements often without the provision of medical insurance, pension or other social benefits. Finally, the downsizing and streamlining of large enterprises or their re-allocation to countries with abundant and cheap labour have lead to a significant decline in the supply of jobs by this segment of the corporate sector. The above trends have been accompanied by the proliferation of sole proprietors and small- and medium-sized enterprises, which, in France or the United States, for example, have become a real engine of growth and/or employment-generation. However, in some other countries, SMEs have emerged in response to unemployment and the shortage of the supply of new jobs, mainly as a survival strategy of households. In this group of countries, SMEs have been functioning as an absorbent of labour force released from re-structuring enterprises without making any significant contribution to the GDP formation. In most of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a relatively large proportion of the released labour has moved into the informal sector (the grey or black economies), where the working conditions are even more insecure than in those labour market segments with the short- and fixed-term work arrangements. It is important to note, that the problem of sustainability of SMEs is very acute in many countries of the region, and the death rate (or the exit rate) among such enterprises has been relatively high. Disparities in the entry rate throughout the countries, on the other hand, point to another problem characteristic to the SME sector - the presence of significant barriers to establishing new enterprises and difficulties, which have been faced by aspiring entrepreneurs in mobilizing initial capital, representing, in most instances, administrative obstacles and the reluctance of the banking sector to provide loans to small entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the opportunity set for entrepreneurial activities differs from country to country, depending on the structure of local demand. At the same time, the mix of opportunities available to would-be entrepreneurs at the local level may change very quickly, as some countries become more deeply integrated into the European Union or in the global economy. It is important for policy-makers of these countries to develop such youth entrepreneurship policies, which would take these perspectives into account and would promote entrepreneurial activities that could benefit from enlarged markets. In the light of the above, the potential and possibilities of youth entrepreneurship should be considered in the context of the economic realities of the countries in question to avoid unrealistic expectations or wrong choices. The exchange of national experiences could provide some clues, but in the end, policies and programmes should be suited to local conditions and countries\\' circumstances. The lessons from the experiences of many countries imply that. Youth entrepreneurship should not be seen as a magic cure of youth unemployment. Youth entrepreneurship policies and programmes should complement broader youth employment strategies and policies. Only a small proportion of young adults could become real entrepreneurs. The age and, consequently, life and work experience do matter. Youth entrepreneurship programmes and schemes tailored to the specific characteristics of each age category of youth (teenagers and/or young adults) have proved to be more effective. So, it is of paramount importance to develop policies and policy instruments, which would be flexible and selective enough to ensure that the majority of young people would be provided with an appropriate set of skills and relevant experience prior to their entry to the real world of business. Considering the growing flexibility of economies, the rapid pace of technological change and the pressure of competition generated by globalization, it is increasingly acknowledge that to avoid the risk of large-scale marginalization, societies should encourage the development of entrepreneurial skills among their younger members. In many countries of the region, various courses in business administration and management, problem-solving, Economics and etc. were introduce into the school curriculum to promote a culture of enterprise and the idea of the self-employment as a career option. Attempts have been undertaken to make professional education in business management, at the college and university levels, less academic and more linked to the needs of the business sector and local communities. Similar efforts were made to expose secondary school students to the realities of business. Many countries have been making a special effort to integrate marginalized and disadvantaged youth groups into the mainstream economic activities through targeted youth entrepreneurship programmes and schemes. The scope and the scale of such programmes vary, ranging from the provision of training, counselling, mentoring, start-up loans to a more comprehensive integrated approach (Italy, Canada, USA, Ireland and United Kingdom). Despite of national specifics, some common approaches and practices seem settled throughout the UNECE region on the following patterns. Promoting and introducing the self-employment option. Training in necessary skills for self-employment. Mentor support. Access to finance. Access to work space. Business expansion support. Access to support networks. These practices and approaches appeared to be most effective, when certain conditions are present. To what extent they are as effective under the conditions of transition will be seen from the results of the efforts to replicate them (e.g. in Slovenia, Hungary, Macedonia). Learning Entrepreneurial Skills at School. Among the most successful stories at the school level are: the YES Programme (Youth Enterprise Society Programme) and the REAL (Rural Entrepreneurship through Action Learning) Enterprise Programme developed in the USA. The YES Programme, created by Ohio State University, has been targeting youth at school with the goal to equip them with the skills, which would be appropriate for the world of work and self-employment. It operates throughout the school years as an extra-mural activity. Students join the programme at Standard 7 and proceed through Standard 8 and 9. They graduate in Standard 10 or after school. While in the programme, students acquire business competencies through a set of special learning and experimental activities. Teachers, after receiving a special training, serve as facilitators. The programme has been provided with support from local businesses, municipalities, parents and NGOs through Local Enterprise Councils. This support, apart from voluntary monetary contributions, has included internships in local enterprises, provision of instructors, study tours and etc. The REAL Enterprise Programme targets the high school students in the rural areas of the USA by linking education with rural economic development and by assisting young people to identify a business opportunity, to prepare a business plan and initiate their businesses, while they are still at school, which later on would be converted into real enterprises, owned by the former students (see box 1). Box 1. REAL Enterprise, Inc., USA. Entrepreneurship education programmes in the USA, initiated by both business and educational establishment, are being developed to re-establish a traditionally important resource for rural communities: local schools and colleges. School-based enterprise programmes represent an example of how rural school can play a significant role in community economic development. One of the mostly highly developed school-based enterprise programme is REAL Enterprise, Inc. REAL has originated in North Carolina in response to the sobering realities of poor local educational and work opportunities for rural youth. Without alternatives, rural communities are at risk of lacking qualified individuals for vital roles in local communities and economic activities. North Carolina REAL Enterprise is a non-profit organization that partners with community colleges and high schools to implement experimental, \"hand-on\" courses in entrepreneurship education. REAL Enterprise, Inc. has four primarily goals. Institutional goals: to help rural schools become effective small business incubators. Educational goals: to help students and teachers develop understanding of, interest in, and competence around entrepreneurship and small business management/ownership. Economic goals: to help create good new local jobs through identifying and utilizing untapped opportunities in the local economy. Individual goals: to help foster a sense of empowerment and heighten the capacity to be successful productive community members. REAL Enterprise process - based on the premise that action learning enhanced skills - depends on active student participation and decision-making. Students conduct a community survey to identify needs that could lead to entrepreneurial ventures. Once these are identified, business plans are developed, funds are secured and a business site is established, thus providing students the opportunity to learn the concepts and responsibilities of managing/owning a business. REAL businesses then \"spin off\" from the school and are independently owned and managed by students who have participated in the REAL Enterprise Programme and have graduated from school. Examples of REAL Enterprise student ventures initiated range from a day care centre to a training booth/exercise centre. (http://www.ncreal.org/REALInfo/. Since 1990, more than 5,000 youth and young adults have received intensive entrepreneurial training within REAL programme. A survey of 400 REAL graduates (from 1992-1998), conducted in 1998, showed that these businesses had not only survived, but also expanded, reaching total volume of sales of $6 million and creating 686 new jobs. Another study found that that the survival rate of the REAL enterprises after 7 years since their establishment was 91-92 percent. In 1999-2000 academic year, NC REAL was serving 64 of North Carolina\\'s 100 counties through their local schools and community colleges. The successful experience of the REAL programme was replicated in other rural areas of America, and its business-incubator approach has been tried in urban areas as well. The attractiveness of this approach lies in its effectiveness to match the local supply of skills with the local demand for skills as close as possible, but also to provide young people with appropriate skills for self-employment. In the urban settings, the focus has been on youth in- and outside school, dropouts and other disadvantaged youth. One of the most recent examples is the Entrepreneurial Training and Merchandising Programme in the Upper Manhattan of New York for young people between the ages of 12 and 18, developed by a non-profit organization, the Institute for Youth Entrepreneurship. The programme includes an educational component that comprises of six semesters of entrepreneurship and elective courses. In addition, the programme provides hands-on experience through the \"living businesses\" created and run by students. These businesses are focused on developing products attractive to tourists: T-shirts, baseball caps and coffee mugs. Students manage all product design, manufacturing, marketing strategy development and sales. In Ireland, the Golden Vale Young Entrepreneurs Scheme, aiming to stimulate enterprise and innovative activity amongst young people, has been encouraging and assisting the organization of Young Entrepreneurs Schemes (YES) within schools. They are opened to all second-level students. Through YES students, either individually or in groups (up to 5 students), create and operate their own real mini-businesses. These businesses sell products or services to students, or outside the school. The objectives of YES are. to assist the development of entrepreneurial skills, self-confidence and self-reliance. to help create an enterprise culture and stimulate entrepreneurial activity; and. to help young people respond to the changing employment situation by encouraging initiative. YES is organized by the Young Entrepreneurs Association, which is an informal group of parents and teachers, working on a voluntary basis. It coordinates the overall Programme; provides extensive support to local organizers; and arranges Regional and National Competitions. The first YES was established in 1991. Since then, it has expanded very rapidly throughout Ireland. Since its foundation, over 50,000 students have participated in YES. In 2000, 8,000 from 271 schools took part in the programme. Concerned with the increased unemployment among college graduates, many UNECE countries have been making an effort to widen the career choices of college graduates by exposing them to the realities of small businesses and allowing them to explore their own potential for self-employment. The Graduate Programme of the United Kingdom, for example, is a national programme, targeting the final-year undergraduates of any discipline for a range of training workshops and placement opportunities within local businesses. In many countries in transition, there has been a dramatic increase in the provision of various training options in business management, finance, accounting and etc. to meet the demand of the growing enterprise sector. Educational reforms have attempted to remedy the lack of training in problem-solving skills and cost-benefit analysis in some fields of study, while improving or restoring the linkages between the educational establishments and the enterprise sector under the new conditions. It is interesting to note, that in many of these countries, the businessmen are younger on the average than in the countries of the European Union. According to one study, over half of businesses in Poland and Estonia are run by the entrepreneurs under 40 years of age, while in United Kingdom, Germany and Greece, less than 36 percent. However, this fact should not be misleading. Such a difference is mainly a result of transition, and the novelty of business activity for the former socialist countries. Other facts speak of the difficulties faced by young people in finding a decent job and income-generating opportunity. Youth unemployment rates in most of the UNECE economies in transition are higher, on the average, than those in the EU countries, and there are 18 million of young people between 15 and 25 years of age, who are neither at school nor in the labour market. Many countries in transition have begun to address these problems by promoting, amongst other means, youth entrepreneurship. Integrating Marginalized and Disadvantaged Youth. One of the biggest challenges faced by countries of the UNECE region is the integration of marginalized and disadvantaged youth groups into the mainstream economic activities. These groups, as well as the primary causes of their disadvantaged position, are very diverse. Depending on a concrete situation and country, these could be the children of immigrants, ethnic minorities, indigenous population, youth in remote areas or declining regions, and youth, whose lives have been affected by the broken family, loss of parents, conflict and displacement, or who have experienced abuse and violence, or have been suffering from disabilities. In some countries of the UNECE region, the total number of such young people has been on rise due to ethnic conflicts and civil wars, on the one hand, but also as a result of the collapse of families under economic hardship, loss of jobs and impoverishment. While youth from some ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples have been disadvantaged by lingering effects of the past discriminatory practices, youth from some other ethnic groups was affected by a recent breakdown of special arrangements, which function was to equalize the opportunity sets of various ethnic groups, at least to some degree. In some countries of the region, the total number of marginalized youth has recently increased also as a result of the erosion of social mechanisms/channels, which were in charge of ensuring a smooth transition of young people from school-to-work. The development of alternative mechanisms has been slow, leading to the loss of contact with many young people. In this respect, the experience of some market economies to reduce social marginality, especially, of Canada, USA and some Nordic countries, could be of great value to some countries in transition facing similar challenges. It is important, however, to differentiate among the marginalized youth sub-groups. While the forms of manifestation of social marginality among different marginalized youth sub-groups could be the same (e.g. high rates of drug-addiction, other substance abuse, crime, suicide, unemployment, school dropout, and etc.), the primary reasons, as well as the circumstances and conditions of their existence, significantly vary. Furthermore, some ethnic sub-groups are static, others, like the Roma or some peoples of the Extreme North, on the contrary, highly mobile. The differences between the youth marginalized groups are a result of the complex interplay of various factors (geography, way of living, historic factors and etc.), and should be well understood to ensure the success of an entrepreneurship policy and programme. Differences are present among the urban marginalized youth sub-groups as well. In some countries, where segregation patterns by income or ethnicity have been persisting, such marginalized youth sub-groups are easily identifiable. In countries in transition, however, marginalized youth sub-groups have emerged as a result of recent changes. Some of them are relatively large and diverse, and represent a by-product of economic decline of whole regions. In the metropolitan urban areas, marginalized youth sub-groups are, in most instances, formed by runaways, drug-abusers, school dropouts, but also by those from the poor households and by discouraged unemployed youth. The experience of countries with integrating marginalized youth through entrepreneurial schemes has been mixed. The situation has been further complicated by the competition from the organized crime, trying to recruit new members from such youth groups. The costs of such schemes (USA, apparently, has spent billions of dollars on funding programmes targeting marginalized youth) are usually high, while the results are not properly evaluated. Phare/Hungarian project for integrating the Roma youth, for example, will cost more than EUR 14 million (see box 2). Such high costs of programmes are one of the reasons, why many countries in transition shy away from the problem of youth marginality. However, there are some effective approaches, which allow to reduce the public share of the financial burden, particularly, through partnerships with communities, NGOs and the private sector. Box 2. \"Social Integration of Disadvantaged Youth with Particular Emphasis on the. Roma Minority\", Phare/Hungary. The European Union supports Hungary in its preparation process for accession with the Phare program. As the Roma issue in Hungary is as much a social as an ethnic issue, the approach chosen, with the agreement of representatives of the Roma Minority, is of a social nature, aiming at the social integration of disadvantaged youth. The programme is centred on the concepts of prevention, correction and promotion. Preventive measures serve to reduce primary school dropout rate among socially disadvantaged, especially among the Roma. Focus on the secondary education with supportive schooling (catching up and vocational training) aims at correction, while support for talented young Roma and their resulting increased number in higher education will contribute to their social promotion. The programme is implemented under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education in co-operation with the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs. A Steering Committee has been set up comprising of, among others, the representatives of both ministries, representatives of the Office of National and Ethnic Minorities and of the National Roma Minority Self-government, and the Delegation of the European Commission has the status of permanent observer. The wider objective of the project is to provide for the social integration of disadvantaged youth, especially the Roma, in line with he medium-term priorities of the Accession Partnership political criteria while the immediate objectives are as specified in the following: improvement of the standard of primary education among the members of socially disadvantaged groups, especially among the Roma minority; prevention of the exclusion of socially disadvantaged youth, especially of the Roma community. In the frame of the project, among other things, new dormitory space for Roma students is created; and the number of socially disadvantaged youth obtaining secondary vocational qualification should be increased. The project activity commenced in May 2000 and ends in December 2002. The total budget of the program amounts to EUR 9.6 million from which the Hungarian government institutions contribute about 48 percent, about EUR 5 million. Canada, for example, has been implementing a comprehensive strategy to promote entrepreneurial activities among indigenous youth, involving the entire tribal community, local, provincial and federal governmental structures and their resources. The USA has been pursuing the whole set of entrepreneurship programmes in attempt to diffuse the pockets of marginality. This has been done through a variety of instruments, including the Small Business Administration (SBA). The USA approach also envisages the involvement of various social actors at all levels of execution, including private financial intermediaries for distributing loans. Such an approach allows to reduce the cost of programmes, while reaching all those in need. Disabled Assistance: SBA conducts special study to help the disabled veterans succeed in business. The SBA has not been provided funding for direct assistance loans, but such individuals are eligible for all SBA loan guaranty programs. Disasters: The purpose of the SBA\\'s Disaster Loan Program is to offer financial assistance to those who are trying to rebuild their homes and businesses in the aftermath of a disaster. By offering low-interest loans, SBA is committed to long-term recovery efforts. The agency will do everything possible to meet the needs of those otherwise unable to put their lives back together. Historically Under-utilized Business Zones (Hub Zones): The HUB Zone Empowerment Contracting program provides federal contracting opportunities for qualified small businesses located in distressed areas (see box 3). Minorities: The most well-known element of the Minority Enterprise Development (MED) program is the 8(a) Program, named from Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. The 8(a) Program is a business development program that provides its participants access to a variety of business development services, including the opportunity to receive federal contracts on a sole-source or limited competition basis. Under the 8(a) Program, SBA enters into prime contracts with federal departments and agencies and subcontracts the performance of work to disadvantaged small businesses that are certified participants in the program. Pre-qualification: A program that uses intermediaries to assist prospective borrowers in developing viable loan application packages and securing loans. Natural Resources Sales Assistance Program is intended to (a) ensure small business concerns obtain a fair share of government property sales/leases to include, where necessary, small business set-asides, and (b) provide counselling, and other assistance to small business concerns on all matters pertaining to Government sales/leases. All the SBA programmes listed above, while do not target specifically disadvantaged youth, have been extended to young adults, seeking funding to start up their own businesses. The entrepreneurship programme for historically under-utilised business zones has been used, for example, to provide a support for the Harlem youth entrepreneurship scheme, mentioned in the previous section. Box 3. Historically Under-Utilised Business Zones. USA Small Business Administration. PROGRAM HISTORY. The HUB Zone Empowerment Contracting program was enacted into law as part of the Small Business Reauthorisation Act of 1997. The program falls under the auspices of the US Small Business Administration. The program encourages economic development in historically under-utilised business zones - \"HUB Zones\" - through the establishment of preferences. TYPES OF HUB Zone CONTRACTS. A competitive HUB Zone contract can be awarded if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that at least two qualified HUB Zone small businesses will submit offers and that the contract can be awarded at a fair market price. A sole source HUB Zone contract can be awarded if the contracting officer does not have a reasonable expectation that two or more qualified HUB Zone small businesses will submit offers, determines that the qualified HUB Zone small business is responsible, and determines that the contract can be awarded at a fair price. The government estimate cannot exceed $5 million for manufacturing requirements or $3 million for all other requirements. A full and open competition contract can be awarded with a price evaluation preference. The offer of the HUBZ one small business will be considered lower than the offer of a non-HUBZ one/non-small business-providing that the offer of the HUB Zone small business is not more than 10 percent higher. The HUB Zone Empowerment Contracting program provides federal contracting opportunities for qualified small businesses located in distressed areas. Fostering the growth of these federal contractors as viable businesses, for the long term, helps to empower communities, create jobs, and attract private investment. HOW THE HUB Zone PROGRAM WORKS. The US Small Business Administration (SBA) regulates and implements the program and determines which businesses are eligible to receive HUB Zone contracts, maintains a listing of qualified HUB Zone small businesses that Federal agencies can use to locate vendors, adjudicates protests of eligibility to receive HUB Zone contracts, and reports to the Congress on the program\\'s impact on employment and investment in HUB Zone areas. ELIGIBILITY. A small business must meet all of the following criteria to qualify for the HUB Zone program. - It must be located in a \"historically under-utilised business zone\" or. HUB Zone. - It must be owned and controlled by one or more US Citizens, and. At least 35% of its employees must reside in a HUB Zone. HISTORICALLY UNDERUTILIZED BUSINESS Zone. A \"HUB Zone\" is an area that is located in one or more of the following. A qualified census tract (as defined in section 42(d)(5)(C)(i)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). A qualified \"non-metropolitan county\" (as defined in section 143(k)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) with a median household income of less than 80 percent of the State median household income or with an unemployment rate of not less than 140 percent of the state-wide average, based on US Department of Labour recent data; or. Land within the boundaries of federally recognized Indian reservations. It should be noted that, in most instances, those youth entrepreneurship programmes, which were preceded with a thorough research of a target group (see box 4), applied an integrated approach, containing all the remedial components (each addressing a particular set of disadvantages), have appeared being more effective than others. The referred components usually included: promotion of self-employment option; training in the skills needed for self-employment; support services, including mentoring; access to finance, work space and networks; and business expansion support. Best youth entrepreneurship programmes had them all. Box 4. Disadvantaged Youth, Public Welfare Foundation (USA. Employment, Training and Alternative Education - Programs that provide quality education, employment readiness services with job placement and other assistance for young people who have dropped out of school, experience chronic unemployment, and have minimal or no job skills, so that they may achieve independent living for themselves and their families. Early Intervention - Programs that promote positive youth development through services designed to prevent educational failure, delinquency, developmental delays, adverse health, or neglect. Services also include assistance to children whose parents are adolescents, affected by HIV/AIDS, involved in substance abuse, or incarcerated. Youth Empowerment and Leadership Development - Programs that provide opportunities for youth leadership development in conjunction with their community\\'s economic and civic development. Violence Prevention - Primary prevention services to reduce violence in neighbourhoods and families, especially violence caused by the availability of guns and other weapons. Advocacy and Policy Development - Programs that promote systemic responsiveness to the needs of low-income young people within federal, state and local policies and practices. A very special marginalized youth group, which disadvantages need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner, is the youth with disabilities. In some countries of the UNECE region, their number has increased as a result of armed conflicts (Tajikistan, Russian Federation, some of the south-eastern European countries, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia). One of the examples of the comprehensive idea to better integrate this disadvantaged group is a recent American \"New Freedom Initiative\", launched in 2001. The \"New Freedom Initiative\" is composed of the following key components. Increasing Access to Assistive and Universally Designed Technologies. Federal Investment in Assistive Technology Research and Development. The Administration will provide a major increase in the Rehabilitative Engineering Research Centres\\' budget for assistive technologies, create a new fund to help bring assistive technologies to market, and better coordinate the Federal effort in prioritising immediate assistive and universally designed technology needs in the disability community. Access to Assistive Technology. Assistive technology is often prohibitively expensive. In order to increase access, funding for low-interest loan programs to purchase assistive technologies will increase significantly. Expanding Educational Opportunities for Americans with Disabilities. Increase Funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In return for participating in a new system of flexibility and accountability in the use of Federal education funds, states will receive an increase in IDEA funds for education at the local level and help in meeting the special needs of students with disabilities. Focus on Reading in Early Grades. States that establish a comprehensive reading program for students, including those with disabilities, from preschool through second grade will be eligible for grants under President Bush\\'s Reading First and Early Reading First Initiatives. Integrating Americans with Disabilities into the Workforce. Expanding Telecommuting. The Administration will provide Federal matching funds to states to guarantee low-interest loans for individuals with disabilities to purchase computers and other equipment necessary to telework from home. In addition, legislation will be proposed to make a company\\'s contribution of computer and Internet access for home use by employees with disabilities a tax-free benefit. Swift Implementation of \"Ticket to Work.\" President Bush has committed to sign an order that directs the federal agency to swiftly implement the law giving Americans with disabilities the ability to choose their own support services and maintain their health benefits when they return to work. Full Enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Technical assistance will be provided to promote ADA compliance and to help small businesses hire more people with disabilities. The Administration will also promote the Disabled Access Credit, an incentive program created in 1990 to assist small businesses comply with the Act. Innovative Transportation Solutions. Accessible transportation can be a particularly difficult barrier for Americans with disabilities entering the workforce. Funding will be provided for 10 pilot programs that use innovative approaches to developing transportation plans that serve people with disabilities. The Administration will also establish a competitive matching grant program to promote access to alternative methods of transportation through community-based and other providers. Promoting Full Access to Community Life. Promote Homeownership for People with Disabilities. Congress recently passed the \"American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000,\" which will permit recipients with disabilities to use up to a year\\'s worth of vouchers to finance the down payment on a home. The Administration will work to swiftly implement the recently enacted law. Swift Implementation of the Olmstead Decision. President Bush has committed to sign an order supporting the most integrated community-based settings for individuals with disabilities, in accordance with the Olmstead decision. National Commission on Mental Health. President Bush has committed to create a National Commission on Mental Health, which will study and make recommendations for improving America\\'s mental health service delivery system, including making recommendations on the availability and delivery of new treatments and technologies for individuals with severe mental illness.

The execution of youth entrepreneurship programmes has differed from country to country in terms of organizational arrangements and executing agent. In some countries, such as USA and Canada, they have been delivered through various arrangements: business incubators, youth councils, youth information centres, special young people facilities and funds, by NGOs, governmental institutions (such Department/Ministry of Education, Human Resources, Industry, Commerce and etc.), joint boards, special structures (SBA in USA or Aboriginal Entrepreneurship Foundation in Canada) and etc. This unavoidably creates a coordination problem and complicates the monitoring and evaluation of the programmes. As a result, the number of studies on youth entrepreneurship programmes is very limited. Further studies and impact assessments are needed in order to establish, which approaches have been working and which failed and why. Partnerships in Promoting Youth Entrepreneurship. Partnership approach is becoming very popular nowadays, including in promoting youth entrepreneurship. To some extent, this reflects the maturity of civil societies in the UNECE countries, where various coalitions, uniting representatives of different social groups around common interests or goals, have become an instrument of social interaction. But this also reflects the degree of societies\\' understanding, that youth problems, if not addressed today, may result in much higher social costs of tomorrow. Each social agent has his own stake in supporting entrepreneurial activities among youth. For the private sector, the main reason of being involved is that its support for youth entrepreneurship and other youth programmes would bring a more secure future, but also healthier, more skilful and entrepreneurial labour force. For Governments, the benefits of youth entrepreneurship programmes are: (i) broadening of revenue base, (ii) cutting public expenditure on welfare benefits and law enforcement, (iii) ensuring cooperative and constructive behaviour patterns among youth, and etc. For many other civil groups, their involvement in youth affairs brings moral satisfaction, but also a guarantee of a better and safer future. For the international community at large, promoting youth entrepreneurship and youth employment means mitigating risks of conflict, which are often rooted in social marginality and the frustration of the marginalized. There are diverse partnership schemes in operation throughout the UNECE region. Examples range from small firms, such as bakeries, teaching disadvantaged youth the secrets of their business, to large-scale renowned programmes that have been extending their helpful hand to countries in transition. The latter include, for example, Junior Chamber International, Rotary International (UK), Livewire (UK), Achievers International (USA) and the REAL Enterprise Programme (USA). Corporate and private foundations have also been active in this field, including Soros, Ford, Mott and Microsoft Foundations, but also large companies, such as Lotus, Hewlett-Packard, IKEA and many others. In countries in transition, the local private sector has not yet been active in public affairs and needs an encouragement and a framework for its involvement. The obstacles for building such partnerships have to be removed. As for other social actors, there are some constraints, which need to be tackled jointly in order to build a social consensus. In some countries, the major constraints are: lack of resources, organizational capacities, and lack of leadership. In some other countries, however, these are further aggravated by more profound and fundamental problems, such as: the lack of compassion and solidarity; and public apathy. In the light of these, it is crucial for the international community to provide a support for those few in these countries, who dare to speak on behalf of young people about their needs, and who express the readiness to mobilize a social action aiming to improve the opportunity sets and future perspectives of the youth in their countries. It is even more urgent in view of some recent in the youth situation of some countries: growing hate and militant movements, criminalization, proliferation of drug-abuse and HIV/AIDS infection. Furthermore, the resource base of most countries in transition is very limited, and there are conflicting priorities. Nonetheless, the problems of youth cannot be put on a waiting list until the economic situation becomes better. In should be understood that youth entrepreneurship programmes is a means to release the pressure on the labour market and to give a rise to new clusters of economic activities, and, therefore, to help recover economic growth. The design of such programmes should be based on a serious assessment of the skills of young people and the local demand for products and services. Business incubators or techno-parks could serve as instruments of promotion of youth entrepreneurship, but they also could serve as providers of training, workspace, funding, mentoring and other business services. To ensure that business incubators and techno-parks are able to meet the expectations and demand, they should be provided with enough capital. Funding of start-ups is extremely important, and various options could be considered. For more static groups, living in closely tied rural or ethnic communities with a relatively strong social control, a group/communal collateral could be used for mitigating financial risks. For urban, more dynamic groups, the involvement of financial intermediaries, following the example of the USA SBA, could be tried. It is also important not to restrict and downgrade youth initiatives. With this regard, an appropriate body should be established, on the volunteer basis, for example, by mobilizing local scientists, entrepreneurs and economists, to conduct a qualified testing of the business ideas generated by young people. To stimulate the creativity of youth, local, regional and national awards for the best business idea could be established. In some countries in transition, there are specific youth groups, which are at highest risk of marginalization. They have to be on the Government\\'s priority list. In Romania, for example, these are thousands of orphans, placed in public care. In some other countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and some of the south-eastern European countries), youth in refuge should be a priority. While younger children could be trained in entrepreneurship skills at school, the older young people, 19-25 year old, should be motivated to join youth entrepreneurship schemes and provided with all necessary support to start their own businesses, if they wish so. Entrepreneurship, however, should not be the only one career option available to youth. If countries in transition would like to be competitive on both the European and global markets, the majority of young people should be educated in the best possible way. Finally, the role models have a powerful impact on the choice of future career orientation of young people. It is important that the local and national mass media capture the attention of young audience by highlighting success stories, especially, when these stories are about young local entrepreneurs. To involve local businesses in youth entrepreneurship programmes, Governments could consider fiscal incentives, as in the case of the USA. The resources contributed to such youth programmes could be relieved of taxation, at least, partially. Internships and training in local businesses could be also rewarded by deducting appropriate amounts from the companies\\' expenditure. ',\n",

First Regional Forum on Youth. \"Security, Opportunity and Prosperity. Geneva, 26-28 August 2002. YOUTH VULNERABILITY: ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS. THREATENING THE WELL-BEING OF YOUTH. (Note by the secretariat. Discourse on vulnerability as a social phenomenon has been going on for decades and has been closely associated with economic and social changes and the need for a re-adjustment of social protection arrangements. Until 1980s, the welfare states of Western Europe, as well as the United States of America and Canada, have been expanding their social protection system by taking the responsibility for the increasing number of social groups (e.g. ethnic and racial minorities, the unemployed, women, people with disabilities, elderly, children and youth), which their societies recognized as being marginalized and, hence, in need of public support. As a result, the social responsibility of the State has expanded, and numerous public programmes have been put in place to alleviate the high vulnerability of marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Starting from the 1980s, however, the welfare arrangements have been under attack, and a parallel discourse on the responsibility of individual and family to take care of themselves has emerged, therefore, reflecting a fundamental change in the value-reorientation of some segments of the civil society. The chore in favour of revision of social protection has intensified with the collapse of the socialist system, reinforcing the argument in favour of \"minimal State\". During the 1990s, a compromising view gained a momentum with regards to social protection with a strong emphasis on targeting public resources to those most needy or deserving poor, while cutting down or abolishing social protection benefits of the population at large. This re-adjustment of social protection has resulted in the increase of the vulnerability of the population, including the most needy, leading, in some cases, to the formation of pockets of poverty. The Vulnerability of Youth. The prevailing understanding of vulnerability stems from its definition provided by the Oxford English Dictionary. The latter defines vulnerable as may be wounded or harmed, exposed to damage by weapon, crisis, etc. In general literature from different areas of social sciences considers that individuals or groups are viewed as vulnerable if they are predisposed to some negative outcomes. This predisposition can be genetic, biological, psychological, ecological, economic and/or social. Therefore, the vulnerability concept implies a comparatively weaker capacity to cope with external shocks, hazards, contingencies and etc. Young people are perceived to be more vulnerable than adults due to. The lack of life and work experience. Risk-taking behaviour. The lack of knowledge and, hence, understanding of realities. The need to establish themselves among the peer group. Emotional and physical fragility. Economic dependency. The social role and status, and etc. Young age is a learning phase of life. It is also the phase of personality development. One year of life in the age of 15-20 years old has much more significant implications for the later years of life, than in the case of mature adults. What is learned during this phase would be imprinted on the values, attitude and behaviour patterns. Therefore, young adults are least equipped to withstand external shocks in all respects. Psychologically and emotionally, they are less prepared to cope with adverse changes and stressors. The young react much strongly to failures and disappointments and need support for overcoming emotional distress, and they are less resistant to outside suggestions, ideologies and persuasive advertising. Young people need to establish themselves among the peers, and therefore, are at risk of deviant action to gain the approval of the peer group. Curiosity and experimentation, natural characteristics of the young age, in combination with the lack of experience increases the risk of accident, substance abuse, HIV infection and premature death. The social and economic status of young people makes them vulnerable to a number of risks: abuse by parents and caretakers; homelessness; job and wage discrimination; unemployment; poverty and etc. It should be noted, however, that any risk is just a probability of a particular hazard within the given societal setting, and societies are usually trying to reduce the probability of various hazards. When the probability of such hazards increases, societies usually adjust protection arrangements. With regards to youth, there is an increasingly shared perception that the vulnerability of youth is on rise. This perception has been reinforced by recent negative trends in the youth situation in some countries of the UNECE region. If this perception is correct, a re-adjustment of social protection would be needed to mitigate the risk factors, which probability has grown. Risk Factors Increasing the Vulnerability of Youth. Over the last decade, the UNECE region has been undergoing rapid fundamental changes that have unavoidably affected all structures of human social organization, including the institution of marriage, the family, the institutions of socialization, social protection and safety nets, as well as the organized forms of participation. The entire system of values and beliefs underpinning the overall societal formation has been challenged. These fundamental alterations may be broken into three major groups. - those associated with the post-modernization, which are predominantly evolutionary in nature. They include technological change and the aging of population. - those, which represent a sudden, abrupt abortation of the established development patterns and societal organizations (the disintegration of the State, economic collapse, ethnic conflicts and civil wars); and. those, which are brought about by a resolution of systemic crisis. The latter changes, and the transition process initiated in aftermath, may not necessarily be violent, but they, nonetheless, may cause the collapse of the system. All the above categories of change cause significant and painful adjustments. The two latter categories, however, generate more uncertainty and social marginalization, than the former one due to, firstly, the totality of change, and, secondly, to a more rapid pace, leaving little time and room for a social mobilization to withstand shocks. The social and psychological costs of abrupt societal changes are usually the highest because of the delay in social mobilization. Moreover, as urban societies are much more vulnerable than rural ones, because of a smaller choice of cushioning social mechanisms, the effects of the collapse of social protection system are felt much stronger in terms of income and, consequently, the household consumption. In the societies with strong traditional ties, safety net provided by the extended family could serve as a temporary substitute of formal social protection. However, this alternative is not sustainable the condition of prolonged economic depression. As the experience of other countries shows, urban poverty would unavoidably be extended to rural population, aggravating the overall social situation. In the UNECE region, such a development has been observed in a number of the countries (Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). In the UNECE region, the vulnerability of some industrial societies proved to be fundamental due to the extraordinary reliance on the State. In these societies, the de facto withdrawal of the State from the provision of social protection has had a devastating effect on thousands of families with children manifested in the escalating number of so-called dysfunctional and broken families. Some semi-industrial societies have suffered an additional blow as a result of severing economic ties with the former counter parties, both at the republican and enterprise levels. The effects of the structural inherited problems, which, in the past, had been offset by subsidization and other redistributions, have come into play with all the consequences for production and, hence, population standards of living. In some of the newly emerged states, civil wars and ethnic conflicts further contributed to the social costs of change, bringing these societies to economic devastation. The vulnerability of all the individuals to various risks and contingencies significantly increases under the condition of change. The vulnerability of youth, however, multiplies due to the cumulative effect of risk factors, which tend to aggravate under such circumstances. Risk of Unemployment, Poverty and Social Marginalization. According to many reports and analytical studies on youth, the risk of unemployment has increased in many countries of the region, although the underlying causes have differed. As table 1 indicates, the rate of youth unemployment has been constantly 2-3 time the level of the national average in most countries, including the countries, which have experienced a positive economic growth and significant increase in the supply of jobs over the last decade (USA, for example). In a number of countries of the region, the proportion of youth looking for employment has been extremely high (e.g. Macedonia, Poland, Italy, Belarus, Georgia, Croatia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), and showed a tendency to rise further (Macedonia, Croatia, Georgia, Tajikistan). This implies, that a large proportion of youth (from 30 percent to almost 50 percent of young people of 15-25 years of age) has deprived of learning opportunities, as they were neither at school nor in employment. Therefore, the future employability of these young people will be severely handicapped. In the light of structural changes brought about by new technologies and a skill-bias shift in the labour demand reflected in a growing earning inequality, these young people are at much higher risk of long-term unemployment and poverty, than those young people, who had spent these years at school.

Regional Monitoring Report No.8-2001, The MONEE Project, CEE/CIS/Baltics, 200 UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre, Florence, Italy, p. 158; EUROSTAT. Employment and Labour Market in Central European Countries, European Communities, 2001; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The available country data on youth unemployment shows that the situation is even more acute in some regions within countries, where thousands of young people are trapped without any hope for improvement in the near future due to the collapse of local economies and economic stagnation. According to EUROSTAT, in 2000, regional youth unemployment rates ranged from 2.9 percent (Flevoland in the Netherlands) to 64.7 percent (Calabria in Italy) in the European Union member countries and from 7.9 percent (in the region of Közép-Dunántúl in Hungary) and 73.1 percent (in Severozapaden region in Bulgaria) in Central European Candidate Countries. In many countries in transition, where wages and social benefits have been compressed, young people from poor families have been increasingly leaving the educational system. In Ukraine and the Russian Federation, the upper secondary enrolment rate fell by 8 percentage points between 1989 and 1999. Those, who have acquired some educational credentials, have been experiencing difficulties in finding a job. In the Russian Federation, for example, in 2000, young people of 20-24 years of age constituted the largest group of the unemployed (17 percent), while all young people below the age of 30 - 38 percent. The average annual unemployment rate among the university graduates of Ukraine was 16 percent during 1997-2000. Recent trends in the labour market raise a growing concern that even those young people, who acquired educational credentials, may be at risk of underemployment or being forced into dead-end low-skill occupations. While over the past two decades the market has been rewarding educational achievements by placing a high skill/education premium (according to ILO, individuals with university degree earn from 50 to 100 percent more than those with secondary education), the supply of high quality jobs has been far behind the demand. School leavers and graduates have been facing the ever-increasing competition for well-paid jobs. As a result, a growing number of young people throughout the region have been delaying their entry to the labour market, spending more and more years in education. In 19 countries of Western Europe, participation in high education as a percentage of all 20-24 years olds increased by 19 percentage points between 1970 and 1990. Combined effect of these trends has led to a dramatic change in the level of education of labour force in many countries (by 2000, more than 33 percent of the American labour force had at least a bachelor degree, for example), on the one hand, but also to the inflation of some professional skill due to oversupply and to an increase in earning inequality within the group of wage earners with high skills and educational credentials, on the other. Another noticeable outcome of these mixed trends has been a growing number of educated youth on part-time or fixed-term contractual work arrangements, or in the low-skill occupations. In the mid of 1990s, in the European Union, 35 percent of employees under the age of 25 had a fixed-term contracts, as compared to 14 percent of all employees. The use of fixed terms contracts was especially high in Spain (77 percent of under 25s). As far as the part-timers are concerned, in France, for example, their proportion (of all the 15-29 year-olds) was one in four. Most of the part-timers acknowledge that they have to work in order to earn money to pay for their studies, while some other, that they have to accept a part-time job, because they were unable to find a full time employment. At the same time, in the European Union, one in five 25-29 year olds with university degree were working in routine office or sales jobs. The problems faced by these categories of youth in some countries have been further aggravated by the fact that they are not entitled to social benefits, which are usually attached to the full time employment. On the other hand, the hourly wages offered to them are just a fraction of the adult workers\\' wages in the same categories. So, many have to borrow to pay tuition and other expenses. As a result, the drop out rate among such students is higher than the average for the entire students\\' body. Another important result of the persisting skill-bias market pressure has been an increase in the financial burden of families, which have had to pay for education of their young members and to support them, while they are studying. Not all families, however, are willing or able to sustain such a burden. Young people from the families with a modest income have either to work in order to finance their education, combining work and study, or just to work, because of the need to contribute to the family income. These young people are disadvantaged in two respects. Combining work and study means sacrificing leisure and opportunities to learn other important life skills, and therefore, the quality of their life is lower in comparison with those young people, whose families are able or willing to finance their education. Young people, whose families are unable to meet the cost of education, are even in a more disadvantaged situation, because of being deprived of educational opportunities. This category of youth is at the high risk of relative poverty. Some specific groups of youth in the UNECE countries face a grave risk of social marginalization due to a cumulative effect of historic disadvantages, but also new risks. These groups, depending on a concrete country, include. youth of some ethnic minorities. young people with disabilities. young people under public care. young refugees and immigrants; and. young people of indigenous population. The above groups of youth have a lot in common. They endure discrimination, they live in ghettoes, they are excluded from mainstream activities, and they come from the families of low social status. Although, for the last three decades, attempts have been made to remedy historic injustices committed against some specific social groups, they still crowd at the bottom of social ladder. In terms of educational achievements, income, occupation, property ownership and etc., which are important criteria for allocating social status, these groups have been lagging behind the dominant social groups for centuries. In the UNECE region, a specific group of young people should be singled out as a group at the utmost risk of extreme poverty. These are young people, who have been left to and grew in public care due to various reasons. In some countries in transition, their proportion has recently increased, while the public resources allocated for such institutions have been drying out. Reaching a certain age bracket, these young people have to leave the premises, but having no family, shelter and resources of their own, they are at the risk of victimization, homelessness, criminalization and poverty. Youth in refuge is another group of grave concern, especially in the conflict-torn countries of South Caucasus, Central Asia, and South East Europe, in terms of their employability, health status and mental state. This group of youth could be added to the above one as facing the same degree of danger. The on-going structural changes further heighten the high vulnerability of all the above-mentioned groups of youth. Young people, belonging to these groups face profound risks of long-term unemployment, poverty and exclusion. In some countries in transition, poverty among these groups is so acute, that many young people have been forced in illegal activities. Some became captured in concealed forms of modern slavery or polygamous marriages (in the case of young females) in order to survive. In the countries of Western Europe and North America, the introduction of tougher requirements at the admission to upper secondary school and university together with a dramatic growth of education costs threatens to push young people from poor families further into marginality. Furthermore, a resurgence of discriminatory practices has been observed, as many countries dismantled special educational quotas and programs for young people from the poor and disadvantaged groups. Remedial programs for those failing to meet the test requirements introduced instead appeared having a stigma effect. Graduates of such programs have treated by employers as being handicapped, lacking the capacity and capabilities to work, and only few were able to get a full time employment. In countries in transition, the proliferation of the private provision of educational services, both formally and informally (by public schools and universities), coupled with the impoverishment of the population and rising inequalities, eroded the opportunity sets available to many young (see table 2 and 3). As a result, some of these countries experienced a sharp fall in the school enrolment rates (see table 3). Table 2. Distribution of Earnings in Selected Countries in Transition.

Source: World Bank Data; UNCEF MONEE data. In the Republic of Moldova, for example, the upper secondary enrolment rate fell by almost 30 percentage points, in Turkmenistan - by 50 percentage points, in Tajikistan - by 35 percentage points, in the Kyrgyzstan - 16 percentage points, in Romania - by almost 20 percentage points. At the same time, as income differentiation by education and skills has deepened, the enrolment rate at the university level has climbed up, but so has the drop out rate, as many young people have not been able to sustain the cost of education. This trend mirrors a similar trend in the EU area. During the 1990s, the estimated rates of non-completion of high education varied from 6-13 percent in the United Kingdom, 30 percent in Germany and 64 percent in Italy. Furthermore, the collapse of industrial production, poverty and the lack of employment opportunities have led to de-formalization of economic activities and a rise of grey and black economies, reaching, in some case, more than 50 percent of the formal GDP (e.g. Georgia and Azerbaijan). It could be speculated on the basis of observation and occasional media reports, that many young people of those 18 million, who were neither at school nor in employment, were labouring in these economies. This makes them extremely vulnerable to the risk of abuse, recruitment into criminal organizations, and overexploitation. Risk of Social Deviance, Abuse and Violence. The vulnerability of young people could be heightened by the cumulative effect of interacting various risk factors, resulting in the increased probability of each of the risks. Thus, the impoverishment of the family could undermine the educational perspectives of young members of the family, increase the risk of malnourishment and, hence, diseases. The tension in the relationship between the parents due to unemployment of the head of the family and harsh conditions could lead to domestic violence and abuse. In turn, domestic violence and abuse, as the experience of many countries shows, could force some young people to run away, but in the absence of own resources they would be unable to sustain themselves (to pay for food, clothing and housing). As a result, most of these young people have to live in the streets. Being young and inexperienced, they could be easily victimized, forced into prostitution and/or criminal activities. Once they are captured by criminal organizations, they are unable to escape, because of the threat of violence, but also because of all the above listed factors. According to some findings on youth prostitution, the average age of entry into prostitution is 14, and many of those prostituting became enslaved as children. Homeless youth are emotionally and financially exploitable and therefore especially vulnerable to coercion and recruitment into survival sex, which is an exchange of sex for survival needs such as food, shelter, money or drugs. Since 75 percent of homeless youth are fleeting physical abuse at home, many have few alternatives and are at risk of being entrapped in prostitution. Not all the young people run away, instead, some begin abusing alcohol and other substances. During 1995-1999, in the Russian Federation, the total number of young people in the age category of 15-18 year old, suffering from alcoholism, increased two times, from drug addiction - 3.3 times, and from other substance abuse - almost 4 times. In many countries in transition, institutional uncertainty in terms of law and order, characterized by the weakening of social control, has been accompanied by an increase in predator behaviours among the adult population, but also among the young. The victimized children and young adults often join the ranks of predators. Some other commit suicide and are murdered. Recent national statistics reports an increase in juvenile crime in many countries of the UNECE region, but especially in countries in transition (see table 4). Table 4. Registered Juvenile Crime Rate. (juvenile crimes per 100,000 population aged 14-17. Russian Federation. Source: UNICEF. A Decade of Transition. The MONEE Project, CEE/CIS/Baltics, Regional Monitoring Reports No. 8-2001. Reducing the Vulnerability of Youth by Mitigating Risk Factors. It is easy to say than to achieve this goal. However, the social costs of not doing anything could be enormous. Most of the nations of the UNECE country members are the aging nations and therefore their welfare will be increasingly dependable on the productivity of the shrinking pool of workers from the generations to come. To ensure the required level of productivity to sustain the current level of consumption, youth should receive high quality education today. Therefore, urgent action is needed to offset the impact of income inequalities on educational opportunities of the young people in the region. To improve the supply of jobs youth, it is important, first of all, to stimulate the development of regions in decline. Governments may consider the possibility of launching local recovery programs based on the assessment of the existing local skill pool and other comparative advantages available locally and developed in cooperation with the local communities and the private sector. Youth financial schemes could be set up to allow young people either to move away from the declining regions or to become self-employed. However, youth self-employment should not be viewed as an answer to the present problem of shortage of quality jobs for young people. Stimuli are needed from both, the central and local Governments, to attract investment to such regions, but also special programs to upgrade or to advance the skills of the local labour force. Marginalized youth requires an urgent attention in many countries of the UNECE region. The loss of young people to alcohol, drugs and organized crime is a waste of human life. Rehabilitation programs with vision and determination are needed to ensure that not a single young man or woman is lost. The post-war experience with rehabilitating street children should be recalled and adjusted to the needs of modern time. Successful programs and schemes should be disseminated and shared among the member countries, but only after their impact is seriously assessed. However, it is even more important to stop the organized crime and adult predators from profiting on youth. The extension of national law, punishing for predator acts of their nationals committed abroad, which has been already done by some countries of the region, could be followed by the rest of the UNECE member countries. It is important to make mass media to become socially responsible, as it has become the most powerful educator. The question of the responsibility of press vis-à-vis its freedom should be seriously debated by civil societies in the light of increasingly violent content of mass media products and the effect on youth. Increased taxation of such products could be a means to control the behaviour of mass media. To reduce the risk of poverty, an effective safety net should be installed in all countries of the region. This should include insurance schemes of the owners and employees of SMEs, as well as for young unemployed, allowing their mobility. ',\n",

In view of a growing probability of the HIV/AIDS penetration into the general population and a disastrous economic and social potential of such an epidemic, the United Nations General Assembly held its special session on 25-27 June 2001, \"to review and address the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in all its aspects, as well as to secure a global commitment to enhancing coordination and the intensification of national, regional and international efforts to combat it in a comprehensive manner\". All entities of the United Nations, including regional commissions, were invited \"to be involved actively in the preparatory activities and to participate at the highest level in the special session\". Current situation in the region. North America and Western Europe. Until recently, the ECE region has been considered relatively safe in terms of keeping HIV/AIDS under control. Swift actions, undertaken by the countries, where the HIV cases were first detected, to educate general public and high-risk groups about the disease and possible prevention measures, appeared working, bringing the rate of new infection down, while inducing a change in behaviour patterns, including towards safer sex practices among the general population and, especially among young people. In Switzerland, for example, the percentage of sexually active 17-year-old boys, who had begun having sex by age 17, fell from 65 per cent in 1985 to 54 per cent in 1997. In most western European countries, more than 60 per cent of young people report using condoms during the first time they had sex. On the whole, in western European countries, 80 per cent of the population aged 17-30 consistently adhere to safe sex practices, therefore, alleviating the risk of infection. This trend, however, seems to be reversing. As of the end of 2001, there were cumulatively: 560,000 of adults and children with HIV/AIDS in Western Europe, and 940,000 in North America (USA and Canada) with the estimated number of adults and children newly infected with HIV during the year 2001, respectively, 30,000 and 45,000 (see table).

Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic: June 2000, ISBN: 92-9173-000-9; AIDS epidemic update. December 2001. According to some recent studies, in 2000, there was a 33 per cent increase in HIV cases in Germany after a five-year long period with a relatively low infection rate. HIV diagnoses were 7 per cent up for 2000 in the United Kingdom as well. Most disturbing is an increase of HIV/AIDS among women and young people. A recent review of surveillance and prospective cohort studies, published in the USA between 1981 and 2000, found that over the past 15 years, women accounted for an increasing percentage of HIV-infected persons. In 1999, 32 per cent of new reported HIV diagnoses were in women, of which 38 per cent were a result of heterosexual transmission. While in 1986, women represented 1 in 15 AIDS cases in the USA, in 1999, their proportion went up to 1 in 5, reaching 18 per cent of all AIDS cases. In a half of these cases, no risk factor was identified, therefore, implying that they were infected through a heterosexual contact. As of 31 December 1999, 733,374 cases of AIDS and 430,441 AIDS-related deaths had been reported in the USA, since the first outbreak of disease in the late 1970s. AIDS has become the fifth leading cause of death among all adults aged 25 and 44 in the USA. Among African-Americans in the 25 to 44 age group, AIDS is the leading cause of death for men and the second leading cause for women. Recent findings indicate there has been a growing deviation from the established patterns of safe sex towards a more risky behaviour among some population sub-groups in the USA and western European countries in the recent years. This was observed not only among younger members of such groups, but also among the older ones. To some extent, this may be explained by the response of these groups to the improved accessibility and availability of various options to treat opportunistic diseases associated with AIDS, particularly, to antiretroviral drugs, and, consequently, to the wrong notion, that AIDS has become manageable. Distressingly, in the case of young people, there appeared an increasing lack of knowledge about the nature of the disease and prevention options. The latter may be partially attributed to insufficient efforts in preventing HIV among the new generations of young people, in particular those belonging to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Surveillance data analysed from 25 USA states with integrated HIV and AIDS reporting systems for the period between January 1996 and June 1999 indicate that young people (aged 13 to 24) accounted for a much greater proportion of HIV (13 per cent) than AIDS cases (3 per cent). These data show that even though AIDS incidence (the number of new cases diagnosed during a given period of time) was declining, there has not been a comparable decline in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among youth. Scientists believe that cases of HIV infection diagnosed among 13 to 24-year-olds are indicative of overall trends in HIV incidence because this age group has more recently initiated high-risk behaviours. Females made up nearly half (49 per cent) of HIV cases in this age group, according to the reports from 32 states in 1999. Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The situation has even more dramatically worsened in economies in transition and, especially, in the Newly Independent States, from virtually zero number of HIV/AIDS cases in the 1980s to total 1,000,000 people infected with this fatal disease by the end of 2001. A shocking upsurge of the disease has occurred in the latter region during the year 2000-2001. Estimated number of adults and children newly infected with HIV has rocketed up to 250,000, the steepest increase worldwide. Furthermore, with total number of drug-injecting addicts on rise and the drug injection spreading among sex workers, the risk of HIV transmission through heterosexual contacts to the population at large has become alarming. In Russia, for example, total number of new HIV cases registered annually increased from just 23 people in 1987 to 67,774 in the year 2000 with up to 90 per cent of all cases attributed to drug-injection. In n Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, countrywide up to 1 per cent and in some cities up to 5 per cent of the total population are estimated to inject drugs. In some Russian cities, where the drug injection prevalence is the highest, such as Kalinigrad or St. Petersburg, the HIV infection rates are also exceptionally high, and continue to climb up. There is also strong evidence that HIV-infection has proliferated to other regions. Cases of HIV were registered in Ryasan, Kemerovo, Samara, Perm, Sverdlovsk, Orenbourg and Leningrad oblasts. The highest HIV prevalence (total number of HIV cases per 100,000) was registered in Irkutsk oblast (301), Kaliningrad oblast (286.5) and Moscow oblast (106.5). Similar pattern has been observed in Ukraine, Belarus and the Republic of Moldova, where most HIV cases are also drug related and where available evidences suggest a continuous proliferation of HIV. As in the USA, in the CIS countries, the proportion of young people in new HIV cases has been extremely high. In the Russian Federation, for example, it reached 75 per cent of all the new HIV cases diagnosed in 2000. The share of women is also on rise. The proportion of women to men in all new HIV cases in Russia increased from 1:4 in the 1980s to 1:2 in the recent years. In Central Asia, the Kyrgyz Republic (Osh region) and Kazakhstan (Temirtau) have recently experienced a large-scale outbreak of HIV infection related to drug injection. In the Kyrgyz Republic, according to official estimates, total number of drug-addicts increased from 741 to almost 4,000 over the year 2000, therefore, increasing the potential threat in spreading HIV. In the Baltic States, the HIV prevalence among the drug-addicts was also found to be at the highest level, especially, in the seaport cities, such as Narva (Estonia). As a result, Estonia experienced a real explosion of HIV infection from 9 cases in 1999 to 390 in the year 2000. The above figures may still not reflect a true extent of the HIV diffusion among drug-addicts, as only a small fraction of this high-risk group has been screened. Furthermore, the screening sometimes involves non-injectors, who are at a lower risk, while those who are known to be HIV-positive are excluded, deflating the overall results. In Central and Southeast Europe, high HIV prevalence of around 40-50 per cent was also identified among the drug users of some large cities: Szeczecin (Poland) and Belgrade (Yugoslavia). In the rest of the countries of these two sub-regions, the rates have so far been relatively low. Preventive Measures: Why Do They Seem Failing. According to official reports, most countries of the ECE region have introduced various preventive measures to curb the infection and keep the disease at bay. However, as the above trends indicate, they seem failing some population sub-groups, especially, the young ones, and have not been effective enough to prevent the proliferation of HIV. One of the reasons is believed to be a stigma, which the larger societies in many countries attach to certain behaviours, such as men having sex with men or drug addiction. Until recently, in some countries, such behaviours were considered a criminal offence and were punishable under the Law. Therefore, individuals belonging to such groups have been reluctant to ask for a medical help, and public agencies and non-governmental organizations, involved in the HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns, have not reached them. In some other countries, larger societies openly resisted any idea of public help to be provided to such groups, thus, allowing both the rate of growth of drug addicts and HIV infection to go upwards. The tragedy of Africa, where a cultural reluctance to acknowledge the existence of socially undesirable behaviours had persisted, shows that such an attitude is a luxury under the circumstances and puts the very survival of nations at risk. Furthermore, some recent studies indicate that, in a number of the countries in transition, drug addiction and poverty often closely intertwined, pushing some people of both genders to sell sex for cash, thus, providing a classic bridge for the infection diffusion among the general population. The phenomenon of drug addiction, which is among the leading causes of the HIV spread in many countries of the ECE region, and, especially in economies in transition, is, first and foremost, a manifestation of social escapism. Many societies, who view drug-addicts as social deviants, should ask themselves hard questions, why so many and, especially, young people seek to escape from reality. Could it be that the reality, these societies offer to their younger generations, is far from being perfect? Hypocrisy, violence, abuse, indifference, cruelty, hate, egoism, poverty, greed, to say more, are also heavily present among the essential attributes of this reality. Could they be among the reasons that avert young people from the values professed by larger societies. Recent civil wars, ethnic conflicts, rapid impoverishment of families and whole communities, social polarization, mass displacement, collapse of basic social institutions and criminalization, witnessed in economies in transition during the last decade, are, in many respects, responsible for the rise of drug consumption, but also for the drug production and trafficking in impoverished regions. The geographical patterns of drug consumption are closely intertwined with the regional patterns of economic decline throughout the economies in transition. Regions in decline suffer from high unemployment, poverty and crime. Anecdotal stories from some of such regions allege that massive attrition of workers often coincided with supply of drugs to the affected communities, presumably, organized by owners of enterprises. A recent change in the types of the consumed narcotics in many countries in transition, away from the home-made opiates towards more sophisticated drugs like amphetamine-type stimulants, which require specific skills and a technology for their production, implies the existence of organizations capable to organize production and transboundary distribution networks. A profound increase of income poverty and social disparities that occurred in many countries in transition has had a dramatic impact on both older and younger generations. The ability of many families to provide support and care for their children, including education, has been undermined. Poverty incidence is the highest among young parents with children in all countries in transition. Educational establishments, in their turn, deprived of public funding, in order to survive, underwent a significant privatisation, formally or informally, and, therefore, have begun increasingly to discriminate in favour of children from high-income families. As a result, the proportion of children and young people, who have not enrolled, attended or dropped out of school, as well as the use of child labour and other forms of child exploitation, have been growing. Since 1989, enrolments in general and vocational education have declined by almost 40 percentage points in South-eastern Europe and by 13-14 percentage points in the Newly Independent States, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The sharpest fall in the overall youth enrolment in secondary education was registered in Turkmenistan (boys by more than 27 per cent and girls by 8 per cent) and Georgia (boys by 14 per cent and girls by almost 20 per cent). It was estimated, that, in 2000, more than 20 million young people aged 15-25 out of total 65 million in this age category in the economies in transition, were neither in school nor in employment, and additional 10 million had been actively looking for a job. In many countries, while total number of young people seeking jobs has been growing, their access to employment opportunities has been increasingly complicated by a shrinking pool of jobs and a slow pace of the creation of new jobs in the formal sector. Intensified age discrimination has further undermined their entry into the labour market. This is confirmed by a consistently higher unemployment rate among youth as compared to the national averages. A combination of growing social inequalities and persistent lack of income opportunities in the formal sector has generated a depressing environment and, therefore, a bleak future for many young people, causing social deviance of various types, including drug consumption. In high-income countries, the demand for drugs among young people has been growing for quite some time. Western Europe has become the second after the USA global market for drugs. In many respects, young adults in this group of countries have faced similar barriers to their entry to the labour market as their contemporaries in countries in transition. However, young people in high-income countries are also under the constant pressure of persuasive advertising and mass-media images of winners. Unable to match these images and expectations of their families, some young adults descend into drug addiction. A growing amount of evidence implies that there are links between increased violence against women, children and adolescents, especially forced prostitution, and HIV proliferation. In many countries in transition, prostitution among young people of both genders, particularly in metropolitan areas and economically declining regions, has been spreading. Historically, prostituting behaviour has shown a strong relationship with the economic situation and the availability of income opportunities, and tended to decline with affluence. Under the current conditions of economic hardship, ineffective safety nets, and impoverishment, the vulnerability of young people has been extremely aggravated, especially in most affected countries. Furthermore, with the economic and social conditions deteriorating, total number of families in distress has also increased, undermining their capacity to socialize and protect their young members. As a result, the rate of both criminalization and victimization of young people has escalated in many countries in transition. Moreover, this has been taking place simultaneously with the rise in predator behaviour among the adult population, including rape, forcing in prostitution and trafficking of women and children. Sexual exploitation of women, children and adolescents has become a profitable illicit business in many countries, but in some countries in transition, it has been blooming. Considering that women and young people most often are not in the position to negotiate the terms, under which their sexual services have to be provided, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, is usually not feasible, making the probability of being infected with HIV extremely high, as the experience of South-East Asia or Africa shows. A couple of studies confirm that this is also the case in countries of the ECE region. However, being on the margin of society, many of these people are bypassed by HIV prevention campaigns and public health institutions. Cross-border trafficking of women and children for the purpose of prostitution has become an international concern, not only because it represents a contemporary form of slavery, but also because it constitutes a bridge for HIV proliferation throughout world regions. According to some estimates, more than 250,000 women and children from Russia, the Newly Independent States, and Eastern Europe have been trafficked into Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Canada, and the United States each year. Accounts of the police arrests made in the ECE Member States, including USA and Canada, testified, that women, especially young girls, had been sold for as much as $16,000 each to brothel owners. There has been a shift in the global demand for sex services towards children, which was fuelled, to some extent, by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Older men in affluent countries, concerned with HIV/AIDS, began to seek younger prostitutes in the belief that the probability of infection among children is much smaller than among adult prostitutes. Regretfully, no data exist on how many of the trafficked women and children from countries in transition were able to return to their countries of origin and how many of them acquired HIV infection and when to make any generalization. It is obvious, however, that to arrest HIV proliferation throughout the ECE region, both prostitution and trafficking in human beings should be attacked on the region-wide basis. It should be also noted that the illicit sex business has been increasingly abusing the Internet by advertising sex services worldwide. It has also employed this new technology in search for new victims, especially, among children. Considering this phenomenon, it is paramount to accelerate the work on the regulation of cyber-activities and its enforcement. How to Deal with This Challenge. The above observations suggest that two different situations in the two parts of the ECE region also mean that the required responses are different. In North America and Western Europe, there is an urgent need to rejuvenate and reinforce the previous successful efforts made. In Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to prevent epidemics which threaten to become of much larger scale and having a much more severe socio-economic impact than anything yet experienced in North America and Western Europe. Apart from the three strategic priorities agreed among all United Nations and bilateral agencies, international NGOs and other key stakeholders, namely: i) to increase coverage of HIV prevention among injecting drug users to a minimum level of 60 per cent; ii) to strengthen sexually-transmitted infection prevention and care; iii) to develop comprehensive programmes for young people\\'s health, development and protection, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, - there is also a need for a long-term prevention strategy, which could address the primary causes (some of which are highlighted above) that make people, especially, youth, vulnerable to the HIV infection. To reduce the vulnerability of youth and children may require a serious revision of the existing family protection programmes in some countries. A comprehensive approach is also needed to trim down social disparities through various programmes of public support for small-and medium-sized enterprises and self-employment, including those for youth. Moreover, in many economies in transition, the potential of entrepreneurship is far from being fully realized. Numerous administrative obstacles to market entry need to be removed as quickly as possible to widen the access of masses. It is dangerous for the aging nations to continue to ignore the fact that so many of their young people are deprived of security, justice and future and so many of their children are neglected and abused. Apart from a moral argument, there are pure economic ones. The failure to comprehend the seriousness of the situation and to undertake timely measures may result in the proliferation of HIV beyond the capacity of some ECE countries to arrest it. As the experience of some African countries show, this could lead to the loss of a half of the able population, leaving the elderly and orphans on their own. In the economic terms, AIDS treatment costs may consume up to 60-70 per cent of the health sector budget, as the available projections for Kenya and Zimbabwe show. The support for children and elderly orphaned by the epidemic is another economic challenge to be met. Finally, the loss of skilful labour may significantly undermine the countries\\' capacity for growth, therefore, causing an economic decline. The business community also needs to be more actively involved in HIV prevention. Its reluctance may turn, at one point, to greater losses both in terms of best workers and profits, as workers\\' absenteeism and medical expenditure due to AIDS will soar. As an example of one sugar estate in Kenya shows, over 8 years the company\\'s expenditure related to HIV rocketed by as much as 10 times on health and five times on funerals. It lost to the disease 8,000 days of labour and 50 per cent of labour productivity. Finally, the time has come to translate good intentions, stated in many declarations, into a real global action against organized crime, especially, drug trafficking and trafficking of human beings. There is a need for a concerted and systematic effort by all countries across the world to crush the drug production sites, as well as the distribution networks. This, however, has to be done in a manner, which would not undermine the HIV prevention efforts, by pushing drug addicts and prostitutes underground. Maybe the legalization of some drugs is not so bad a solution after all, taking into consideration the lessons of the age of prohibition. According to recent information, communities throughout the UNECE region have begun to respond to the HIV threat more energetically. More than 150 HIV/AIDS prevention projects among injecting drug-users have been set up, focusing on groups at the highest risk, such as prison inmates, for example. Political commitment of the Governments seems also growing. Practically all the UNECE sub-regional groupings have declared their intention to combat HIV/AIDS in coordinated manner. The members of the CIS have been developing a special declaration and a plan of action. Still, more and urgently needs to be done. The disease is not waiting until we are ready, and is taking a larger and larger toll. ',\n",

A STRATEGIC CHOICE FOR YOUTH EMPLOYMENT. (Document prepared by Valentin Podvysotsky, Ukraine. State policy on support for small business in Ukraine began to take shape with the adoption in 1991 of the Business Act and the establishment of the State Committee for Support to Small Business and Businessmen. The Business Act lays down the general legal, economic and social principles and conditions governing business activity and provides the legal underpinnings for State regulation and support of business and for relations between business entities and the State. In March 1993 the Cabinet of Ministers approved the first Programme of State support for business in Ukraine in furtherance of State policy on the subject. The State Support for Small Business Act defines the macroeconomic goals of that policy. The purpose of State support for small business is, thus. To enable positive structural changes to take place in Ukraine economy. To support the evolution and development of small-scale business activity, and its emergence as a preferred means of overcoming undesirable developments in the economy and bringing about steady, positive social development. GE.02-22079 (E) 050602 120602. To shape conditions conducive to employment for the inhabitants of Ukraine, create new jobs and prevent unemployment. Accordingly, the Act defines the broad aims of State support for small business activity in Ukraine as follows. 1. Creating infrastructure to support and develop small business activity, introducing State training, retraining and advanced training for managerial staff at small business entities. 2. Introducing a system of small business benefits. 3. Introducing a simplified taxation, bookkeeping and accounting system. 4. Providing financing and lending support for small businesses. 5. Enlisting small business activities in technological and socio-economic programmes and providing labour and services to meet State and regional needs. The National Programme for the Support and Development of Small Business Activity in Ukraine, which was drawn up on the basis of the Act, sets more specific goals. Its main objectives are. To create a State system for the support and development of small business activity. To enable small business to develop in the regions. To help small business entities to create new jobs. To support business and investment activity and promote competition on the market for goods and services. To attract women, young people, retirees etc. into business activity. To activate financing, lending and investment mechanisms and look for new forms of financial and lending support for small businesses. To establish regional infrastructure for the development and support of small business activity. To enable small businesses to develop in the productive sector, for example on the basis of restructured enterprises. Expected outcomes of the Programme include: faster development of small businesses, turning their potential to advantage and making them an effective means of addressing economic and social problems; encouragement of structural change in the economy; a steady tendency for the number of small businesses to rise; a reduction in the level of off-the-books trading by small businesses; a greater contribution by small businesses to the Ukrainian economy; a positive impact on the unemployment problem; saturation of the domestic market with goods and services; and a stronger economic base in the regions. Regional programmes addressing key issues relating to State support for small business in the regions, in particular local-level legislative backing, financial support, infrastructure creation, staff training and provision of resources, are an important instrument of State policy. They are discussed and approved at meetings of the local government boards concerned. They are financed out of regional and local budgets, the nationwide and regional business-support and other funds, the resources available to regional employment centres, bank loans, the proceeds of privatizing State property, foreign investment, international funds, resources from regional business associations, and resources provided by those carrying out individual projects and subprogrammes.

ACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT CONSUMERS UNION and. CENTER FOR YOUTH STARTING BUSINESS. (Prepared by Mr. Fuad Huseynov. Azerbaijani Republic. Independent Consumers Union (ICU) is a not-for-profit, independent organization, created on 31 January 1997 and registered with the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijani Republic. The aims of ICU are to defend the rights of consumers and to prevent the goods market from the products and services hazardous to human life and environment. These goals are realized through active public education policies. Azerbaijan is a newly formed Republic, which is on the way of transition from a centrally-planned to a market economy. That is why, the small and medium businesses and entrepreneurship are the main driving forces of building and developing a market economy. Taking into consideration the current situation in Azerbaijan, the Center for Youth Starting Business was established on 5 February 2001. The main goal of the Center is to bring together young people and assist them to acquire the basic knowledge of business. Being involved in studying business and, afterwards, working on starting up their own businesses young adults are prevented from risks faced by them, including the risk of poverty, drug-addiction, and criminalization. The following activities have been carried out by the Center. Seminars on business management. The Center has organized 4 seminars on business management. As a result of the seminars, the number of its members increased by 20 per cent. The following seminars were organized. The role of marketing in starting-up a business. Specific features of transition from planning to market economy. Basic principles of business management. Methods of preparing business plans. Volunteering. The most active members of the Center volunteered for ICU. Participating in different projects of ICU, young men and women enrich their knowledge about consumer rights, gain experience in business sphere and make contacts with national and foreign partners. The Center plans to establish an independent non-governmental organization (\"Union of Youth Starting Business\" - UYSB), create regional offices and employment agencies for young adults, interested in business.
